Unleash your full programming potential with these lovely, colour-coordinated, thigh-high socks! Guaranteed to increase your mark by at least 10* percentage points across all modules. They only come in a single size, but they are quite stretchy.

*may not actually increase grades, we haven't done a scientific study (no-one was available to be the control as everyone already had them)
