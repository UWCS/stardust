We’re proud to be partnered with LUNA Students, a student accommodation provider offering modern, all-in-one studios right here in Canley. 

Their Warwick residence – Burnsall House – is just a 15-minute walk to campus and packed with thoughtful features, including in-room washer/dryers, full kitchens, and a range of spacious studio layouts. 

Each studio comes with a generously sized desk – perfect for coding, studying, or setting up your full gaming rig or multi-screen setup (UWCS priorities, obviously). 

It’s not just about your room, though. Burnsall House also offers brilliant social and study spaces designed to help you stay focused when you need to – and unwind when you don’t. From quiet corners to chill-out zones, there’s a space for every kind of day. 

LUNA offers flexible contracts, low weekly rates, and a friendly student community, making it a great option for anyone looking for independence with all the perks of purpose-built living.
