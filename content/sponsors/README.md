# Sponsors

Sponsors are listed by tier in a sub directory -- tier name order and colour are set in their _index.md. We need a custom template to display this how we want (pages by section, sorted by weight) -- `transparent` mixes up subpage order.

Sponsor images are located next to their `.md` file **with the same name** -- `.png` only instead of `.md`. Note when adding new images, these should be transparent around the logo -- both so light/dark mode looks good, and so the silhouette effect works properly.

If you want to add a new tier, add a new directory, copy in a `_index.md` and change the weights to sort them properly.
