The Academic Coordinator handles the organisation of academic events within the society, this includes:

- Finding 'internal' speakers, i.e. current and past members of the society
- Liaising with the external sponsors to identify when and what they may want to give an event on
- Try to ensure there are minimal clashes with DCS timetabled lectures/seminars and other major events
- Smoothing over any technical issues that might occur when dealing with external events
- Running other events such as revision sessions and courses
