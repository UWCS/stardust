Hello. I am Raven. What am I doing today? Writing the newsletter. What am I doing tomorrow? Not writing the newsletter. (banging intro, thanks Rowan) Exams are done with, so now it is time to chill out and wait eagerly for the next DIMAP social! Weirdly, I actually volunteered to do this newsletter - but it's LAN WEEK! So that means... free snacks, pizza and LOTS OF GAMING. And if LAN ent quite your thing, fear not, we're kicking off the week with some bangers!

# [üçî Pub Meal üçî](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/pub-coach/)
#### üïñ Mon 16th Jun 7pm - 9pm  üìç [Phantom Coach](https://goo.gl/maps/wAptxmC4L7uajZEPA)
#### *I mean, we did go to Phoach - or maybe you had a time machine and saw the newsletter before I even wrote it!*
What even is a week without the crazy convos and potential for MANY MEGA MIXED GRILLS? Who knows, maybe you'll be wondering about the limitations stopping people knowing every language globally - you never know when they might come in handy!

# [üé§ CS Students Cover Hamilton (feat. FREE FOOD) üé§](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/hamilton-cover/)
#### üïò Tue 17th Jun 9am - 1pm  üìç [CS0.02](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?slid=26819)
#### *IS THAT GLOCK*
Are you ready to be part of DCS history? To be part of a **legacy**?? 
Or perhaps you‚Äôre simply ready to beg, steal, borrow or barter for some HOME-BAKED GOODS (made by Irene and Crystal! we promise not to poison you!)

Join us in making a beautiful cover of *‚ÄúAlexander Hamilton‚Äù* about CS Students!
Or if you just want the free food (it‚Äôll be really good) we simply ask that you appear in the video (however this might mean forcing you to sing for up to 10 seconds so... at your own risk)

For proof of our previous work in maintaining DCS history check out [https://www.youtube.com/@GiddyUpGlitch](https://www.youtube.com/@GiddyUpGlitch)
For proof of how good the baked goods will be - trust us. I can bake. These may or may not include savoury foods as well (pizza perhaps?????).

Also feel free to bring along baked goods if you want! More food is always better!

If you have any questions, or IDEAS, please DM Irene or Crystal on our Discord!

# [üçÉ Field Circle: Holy Edition üçÉ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/field-circle/)

#### *We gon' be having a field day with this one*
Why not do it again, this time in a FIELD - after all *one circle is simply not enough*! After all, you gotta touch grass occasionally - and even if you do, there's no guarantee you'll avoid the nuclear punishment bucket if it returns! Even better if you can achieve the TRIPLE crown of *both* circles *and* the Pub Traversal...

For those of you who have **ascended** ‚Äî we‚Äôve planned an extra one. And in true summer spirit, we‚Äôre taking it **outside**. üå§Ô∏è

This might be late... but consider this divine intervention ‚Äî because **we all need to pray for exam success**. üìöüôè

And for the faithful who make it to the end... we‚Äôll be **embarking on a pilgrimage to Smack**.

# Welfare Addendum

Please be mindful of others' faith with your outfit, both for those attending the circle and those who may pass by us. If you have any concerns whilst we're there, feel free to find Raven at the circle.

LAN, after much pain, stress and exhaustion, is returning for a final showdown of the year - we'll be in LIB2 for 48 hours for a roster of much gaming, much snacking, and much fucking around (yay!). Wonder if people who've gone home can come as holograms... (5:57am musings go hard)

__You can bring your PCs, consoles, games and more, all is welcome at LAN!__

**IMPORTANT: We have a planned schedule of events, and it's not required to bring your own devices to participate in LAN**

If you want to know more about what LAN is, are wondering "where the fuck is LIB2" (good question), or have any other questions, we have a **LAN guide** you can check out over at: https://uwcs.co.uk/about/lan/

Featuring FNG++ Pro Professional Ultimate Deluxe Edition, free snacks throughout, **free pizza!**, and many banger events, it's gonna be a wild ride!

We'll have extra background activities including Minecraft UHC, RAAAAAAmphi, Board Games, Milk Midnight, and Just Maybe a surprise cameo...

If you have a Switch 2 you'd be willing to lend, we can turn this into a **Mario Kart World** tournament - we only have one Switch 2 at the moment! (preferably a Switch 2 that you haven't hit with a wrench 50 times like JerryRigEverything mind you)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Balatro Tournament](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-balatro-tournament/)

~~pull out the rug from underneath this CANNIBAL... CANNIBAAAAAL~~ (this playlist goes hard af and ngl, it's a good match for the insanity of a lot of Balatro players - silly hours of the morning being in a *trance*, and getting about as close to real gambling as we're allowed)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Movie Night - Member Vote!](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-movie-night/)
#### üïí Sat 21st Jun 3am - 10am

Yup, that's right, Movie Night is making a return, except **you** get to choose what movies we watch! Perhaps you'll come up with some cursed choices that'll make us lose even more braincells, but hey, I gotta work an open day by the end of this, I'm sure that'll restore my sanity!!! (/s)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Tetrio](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-tetrio/)
#### üïô Sat 21st Jun 10am - 12pm

Maybe you're gonna a bit eepy, whether you went to sleep like a sane person, or if you stayed the whole night hooked on the movies or playing Balatro ~~WE LIKE TO DANCE BUT THE DEAD GO FASTER~~ (yes, deadmau5)! Either way, the more reasonable hours of Day 2 are here, and we're kicking it off with something that *can* be calm depending on your approach - blast away those blocks to your heart's content!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Pokk√©n Tournament](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-pokken-tournament/)
#### üïõ Sat 21st Jun 12pm - 2pm

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Gartic Phone](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-gartic-phone/)
#### üïë Sat 21st Jun 2pm - 5pm

A lot of us are CS students, but we gotta show off our artistic flair sometimes yano - however deranged that ends up being... I'm sure there'll be prompt of all sorts of things, and I'm almost *expecting* someone to give a prompt about wolves at some point, but hey, let the ideas run free!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Quiz Night (feat. FREE PIZZA)](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-quiz-night/)
#### üïî Sat 21st Jun 5pm - 8pm

I mean, come on, Quiz Night is a *staple* of LAN, you didn't seriously think we wouldn't do it right? *Thank God for ABS, 'cause where we are going is anyone's guess* - the playlist *continues* to go hard, but it's true, we are gonna have some banger rounds, some with slightly niche shitposty vibes! It'll be great fun as always, and WHO DOESN'T LOVE FREE PIZZA HMMM... Come along/stay for this absolute highlight, and hey, if you've been working the open day immediately before like me, that pizza gonna taste just that lil bit sweeter!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Geoguessr](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-geoguessr/)
#### üïó Sat 21st Jun 8pm - 11pm

If the quiz and free pizza didn't quite Lift you up enough, then Just Maybe the Geoguessr tournament will, perhaps with a special cameo! The playlist makes me wanna Sing, but you should Read the following: this will be great fun, and anyone can take part, you can be Either a newcomer or up to Rainbolt ability! Match those locations for a Lifetime experience!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [ARCHIPELAGO](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-archipelago/)
#### üïö Sat 21st Jun 11pm - Sunday 22nd Jun 7pm

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIII! The greatest of all game randomisers, with all items scattered across the games, work together to beat as many games as possible - we'll be sending out more info soon, but have a look at [this list of games](https://archipelago.gg/games) and see what games you'd like to see featured! The more we get, the crazier it'll become, so we'd definitely encourage it - and even better is that you don't have to be at LAN in-person to take part for this, so if you've gone home, you can still join in on the madness ~~crash in the mountain tide, you're the fire inside~~ (don't cause any fires pls, in LIB2 or elsewhere - trying not to have a return of ALARM LAN after all!). This monstrosity will be running through to the end of LAN!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Quiplash](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-quiplash/)
#### üïî Sun 22nd Jun 5am - 10am

QUIPLASH. Why is it at 5am? Why the fuck not - also it went hard as fuck at daft o'clock in the morning last year. Everyone had lost just a lil bit of sanity ~~if you're chilling in the dark and you're looking through a telescope you'll see me sipping on a soul of a new hope SO BURN IT DOWN~~ (only fire allowed is FLINT AND STEEL in Minecraft...)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Trackmania](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-trackmania/)
#### üïô Sun 22nd Jun 10am - 1pm

Manic? I was manic once. They locked me in a track. A track full of cars. The cars made me manic. Car go vroom vroom close to walls. Car go vroom vroom over walls.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Pirate Game](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-pirate-game/)
#### üïê Sun 22nd Jun 1pm - 2pm

Nono, not *that* type of pirating... Hoard the gold and return at the end from the ship to your base 0 metres away in the same chair at LAN with yer booty!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Fighting Game Tournament](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-fighting-games-tournament/)
#### üïë Sun 22nd Jun 2pm - 5pm

Push it, pull it, bop it, kick it, punch it - yes I'm going insane, but so is everyone else by this point. Come play Guilty Gear Strive and perhaps more fighting games!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Video Game Relay Race](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w9/lan-video-game-relay/)
#### üïî Sun 22nd Jun 5pm - 7pm

After passing the "Allowed to Sleep" baton around for 48 hours, it's time to finish up LAN with a BANG! More details to come soon - who knows, maybe we'll switch it up and make it a relay race of who can get our games back to DCS the fastest üëÄ

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soon it'll be time to hibernate for the summer, but until then, come make the most of it as we round-up term!

Oh and also small tidbit: the new sticker packs go hard as *fuck* - we'll be sure to reach out about merch generally when we have everything together!

Yes I have been writing about holograms at 5:57am but shhhhhh rattly orbs when late newsletter...
