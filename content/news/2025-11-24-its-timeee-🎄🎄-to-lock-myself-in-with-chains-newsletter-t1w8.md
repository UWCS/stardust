Hohoho, welcome back to the jolliest of all places -- UWCS. It's the place where wishes come true, except for coursework wishes. I'm sorry.

Maybe you can ask Santa Clause for a first, but have you been good?

Children on the naughty list (those who have self-certed) will not be given a first this year.

So I hope you all have been good kids :))

# Welfare Notice
UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Thomas (Discord: tomo.li) - good chance you've seen us around already with the exec hoodies on, but especially since we have a lot of new people, we want to make ourselves known. You can speak to us in-person, or message us over Discord, and we can help give you advice and signpost when you're going through stuff, whether that's trying to navigate the various support systems within the uni, or something has happened involving a member of the society e.g. at an event, and more. Starting uni can especially be quite overwhelming, just know we're here to help, and it's okay to not be okay!

Every Monday we go to one of the local pubs, this time it's at the Dirty Duck off campus! Join us to socialise, grab some food, and maybe have a cheeky drink to kick off the week :)

# [Birmingham Christmas Markets](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/8/birmingham-christmas-markets/)
#### 🕕 Thu 27th Nov 6pm - 10pm  📍 Birmingham
#### *Trash courseworks, buy happiness*
That's right, we're going back to Birmingham! As is an unfortunate tradition, we'll be returning to the 🎄 Birmingham Frankfurt Christmas Market 🎄 (the largest authentic German Christmas Market outside of Germany). So whether you love or hate Birmingham, this is a good opportunity to forget you unfortunately live in England for 4 hours. 

The market is full of all things food, Christmas gift ideas and other ways to spend your student loan! Not to mention a variety of pretty lights, potentially another carousel to fall off of and all the lovely delights of Birmingham Tim Hortons.  Feel free to join us exploring, or wander off at your own pace. I'll be sharing a live tracker throughout the duration of the event so you can find us :3 

Dress up in your favourite Christmas-y outfit, whether that's an awful jumper, deer antlers or donning fairylights - it'll help us keep track of you either way. Make no mistake, your outfit WILL be judged by yours truly.

# [Run Club](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/8/run-club/)

#### *BE FITTER THROUGH THE MEANS OF TOUCHING GRASS*
Weekly runs, open to all members and friends of UWCS. An average week might look like a 5k around campus on a pre-planned route, but as this is the first term for which the event is being run, expect to see a variety of ideas each week.

FOR ALL ABILITY LEVELS.

[Strava - UWCS Run Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1426021)

* Meet outside DCS at 17:00. Won't leave right away.

# [Friday Night Gaming](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/8/friday-night-gaming/)
#### 🕖 Fri 28th Nov 7pm - 2am  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *Games. Unlimited games, but no games.*
The Friday night fun continues in unquestionably the best way to round off the week ~~Raven is definitely not biased in writing this~~, along with free snacks and drinks.

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`) and Sharvil (`w.0lf`) - come find us at any point if you need help, or even just to yap. We'll often be identifiable by our exec hoodies :)

We have a huge selection of fun activities for you to choose from, so come along for a great night :)

There are tons of options for consoles: Xbox with Rockband, Wii, Nintendo Switches (including a Switch 2!), PS4 and more—all having a huge variety of games.

If you are more into Steam, we have that too, just ask us for our DCS account login! Not only that, but you can get full access to the department computers and enjoy a wide selection of free games (wow!)

It doesn't stop there folks. We also have a ~~freaking~~ Oculus VR headset, so you can immerse yourself in Metaverse games. Beat Saber is a popular choice, but we have tons of options!

Did you think that was it? We even have Jackbox along with other party games that will continue through the night.

Hope to see you there :3

Hohoho (again), I'm ready to stay in DCS for 6-7 hours today 💯
