Unfortunately I made some poor decisions and got reelected as secretary. That's a terrible shame, because you've all signed yourself up for another year of insane newsletters, but let's be honest, who actually reads these anyway?

As always, we have our wonderful Welfare Officers here to help you if you encounter any issues: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034)

#### 🕘Wednesday 12th March 2pm - 5pm📍[Bar Fusion/Esports Centre](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/66167610d8dbf518cbed2bfb?projectId=warwick)
#### *The end is near*

The end of term is nearly here! And that means only one thing - no, not more deadlines - it's time for DCS' end of term social!

This term we'll be in Bar Fusion and the Esports centre, with acess to the Esports machines and consoles. DCS are also handing out a Fusion voucher to buy food and drink.

From 4pm, we'll be hosting a quiz with some fun prizes, so stick around to the end!

# [🍔 End of Term Meal 🍔](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t2/w10/end-of-term-meal/)

#### 🕘Thursday 13th March 7:15pm-9pm📍[SHIN restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/yxSrkAJfdHS7dgxBA)
#### *NUCLEAR SUCCESS*

We are going to **SHIN Japanese Kitchen & Bar**, and will consume an inconceivable amount of food which may actually be slightly healthy for once because it's **East Asian cuisine**!😱

Check out their menu [here](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/coventry/coventry-city-centre/shin-ramen)!

Interested in coming? Fill out [this interest form](https://forms.gle/MpU36Cjs2KqBiRUh8)

**If you want a 10% DISCOUNT** (which let's be honest who doesn't) **MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH** since they give a discount on cash (there is an ATM just by the restaurant).

The bus times will be sent out closer to the day, but *we are wanting to get there and sat down for 7:15pm*, so you have been warned.

# [🎮 Friday Night Gaming 🎮](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t2/repeat/fng/)

#### 🕘Friday 14th March 7pm - Late📍[CS Dept](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?slid=23888)
#### *With a side of sports?*

We have a huge selection of games on a ton of consoles, Xbox, Wii, Nintendo Switches, PS4 and more. As usual, we'll have snacks for everyone!

And if you're enjoying the weather warming up, one of our sports officers has decided to take over FNG? So if you're feeling like running a 5k (or 3), FNG is the place to be!

Well I guess my heartfelt sign off from last week was redundant as I'm back... Can't wait for sleep-deprived, exam-stress-fuelled, insane term 3 newsletters season 2! - Ray
