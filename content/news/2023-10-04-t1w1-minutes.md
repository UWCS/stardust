      - Subsidising DCS students was also offered
        - Department needs to see how much they can do along with how much they can rent
      - If there is a minimum of 500 then DCS and UWCS can collaborate and DCS will officially host it
    - Possibly completely hosted by department instead of society
      - SU makes it problematic for society in terms of event and payment
      - Department could invoice society if needed
    - Last year had a working group to organise it, this will be repeated this year
