Hello hello, Crystal is back and I'll gladly announce that I crawled out of term 1, traumatised and physically damaged from the lack of sleep. However, I AM BACKKK for a term full of juicy newsletters~

Also I'm the sober exec for the Wed Circle. Plz Come. 🙏🙏

On a side note, elections is coming up later this term. If you're interested in running for secretary, feel free to DM me *anywhere* but make sure you don't look like a creep so I don't block + report you 💀

# Welfare Notice
UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Tom (Discord tomo.li). We can also be reached via our email inbox at welfare@uwcs.co.uk.

You can speak to us at any time via Discord, email, and in-person (often in our exec hoodies), for advice, signposting and support. This can be for navigating the uni's support services, or to disclose something not right that happened due to someone's conduct at one of our events, and much more.

Any discussions you have will stay with the specific Welfare Officer, unless you permit otherwise.

# [👾🎮 Friday Night Gaming (7pm till LateTM) 🎮👾](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/2/2/friday-night-gaming-(7pm-till-latetm)/)
#### 🕖 Fri 23rd Jan 7pm - 5am  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *Bacon. Unlimited bacon, but no games.*
Friday Nights. Gaming. FNG. That's all we've known. PCs, consoles, VR, snacks and drinks. The pinnacle. The untoppable *and* unstoppable force. Sometimes you must choose between the last U1 and continuing Never Gonna Give You Up on Clone Hero. Your home for some beats? Aye, a worthy sacrifice.

Join us in DCS every Friday from 7pm, until you see Raven conked out on the floor from exhaustion sometime on Saturday.

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`), Sharvil (`w.0lf`), Laina (`vomitspawn`), and Santiago (`colombian.`) - if you need help or just wanna yap, come find us :)

We have our DCS account login - any game (including via Steam!) that you can get running, you can play. We also have several consoles, including Xboxes, PS4, Switch 1 & 2, Wii, along with our PCs which I call Nuke Machine and Microwave, which you can use our Valve Index on, play Clone Hero, and more! We also have board games for anybody wanting a less tech-based way to enjoy games :)

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

Hope to see you there :3 (Note: you don't have to be a DCS student to come along!)

# [⛸️❄️ Ice Skating ❄️⛸️](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/2/2/ice-skating/)
#### 🕐 Sun 25th Jan 1pm - 3:45pm  📍 [Planet Ice, Coventry](https://maps.app.goo.gl/R6xuEDgc8HLV7MPX6)
#### *Falling on your ass is not that bad, trust*
1. Go to Planet Ice website [https://planet-ice.co.uk/checkout](https://planet-ice.co.uk/checkout) and select ice skating and then select Coventry ✅ 

2. Select Sunday 25th of January and then select 1:45pm to 3:45pm public skate ✅ 

3. Select student ticket ✅ 

4. Then on the next page select skates package ✅ 

5. Pay and you're done ✅

Ice slating is honestly SUPER fun. The feeling on gliding on something makes you feel so light and free. Even if you're inexperienced, there'll be people who are pro skaters who can help you out :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again, COME FOR THE CIRCLE. It's the beginning of the term so it's the perfect time to get piss drunk before all the responsibilities, deadlines, pressure start seeping in (I should stop). All in all, good luck with term 2 guys (if you managed to read until the end).
