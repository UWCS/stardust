## Agenda I: Budgets
- Thomas did a budget update recently
    - Our sheet and the SU didn't line up
    - All different incomes are in the same place (WHACK, ticket sales, sponsors, etc), as are expenses
    - WHACK expenses added to make the records more accurate
- Pizza budget is fine!! Wooo!
- Academics
    - Ed Denton might want budget for pizza at end of courses
    - Also maybe a Bletchley park trip
- Socials
    - Most events are ticketed so budget is fine
    - Maybe a BBQ in T3 would have expenses
- Gaming
    - Have spent a lot (more than expected)
    - Raven thinks the budget is fine, expenditure looks scary but expenses can probably be put down to welcome week and Big Fucking Lan 
        - No T2 Lan so no expenses there
        - Main expenses will be FNG snacks from now
        - Sim Racing equipment has been bought ([redacted])
        - WASD budget - Flyers/Publicity, donation goals, pizza order (?) 
            - Worth a discussion on a WASD-specific budget

- Inclusivity Budget has been increased
    - Mostly due to cat cafe trips, so T2 and T3 can go ahead
    - [redacted]
- Welfare budget [redacted]
    - Raven is going to look into running events (like curio again)
    - Raven will follow up
- General note that whilst budgets are categorised (e.g. food budget in gaming), these aren't hard rules and money can be used for other things
    - Don't piss off the treasurers, they'll take your budget away
- [redacted] money

## Agenda II: Frep
- There hasn't been much to do so far
    - Most stuff will probably be related to major events e.g. WHACK
- Possibility of not having a Treasurer Frep, and indoctrinating a different frep
    - Could possibly do something similar with treasurers + freps
