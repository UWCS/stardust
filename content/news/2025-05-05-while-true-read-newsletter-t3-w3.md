Alright guys, I am back from the dead; I've had a hectic 2 weeks of exams, and yet the maths department don't seem to understand STEM students don't usually have exams in week 3... If you're luckier than I am this week, we have a very busy schedule!

In other news, UWCS are going to Thorpe Park! We'll be going at the end of term to celebrate surviving exam season (June 19th), but tickets are on sale NOW!!! Whilst tickets are available until the 22nd May, they're selling fast and we have a limited number of spaces, so to avoid missing out you can find out more details [on the SU website](https://www.warwicksu.com/venues-events/events/4133/26986/) or via our [discord](https://discord.gg/NTDKwvakm6). 

As always, a reminder that we have our usual welfare officers always here to help you: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034)

This term, UWCS is bringing you **TWO CIRCLES** alongside a lineup of *epic* socials - more details coming soon... *trust me*.

**THEME: BIG MEAL**

What does **"Big Meal"** mean?
Great question. The *true* meaning has been lost to time... but that just means you guys get to take the risk of **figuring it out**!

Come dressed as **anything** you'd find in, on, or around a BIG MEAL - whether that's a 🍔 burger, a 🌭 hotdog, a dining table, or even a 🧂 salt shaker. The wilder, the better!

Oh and as always the good old trusty bucket will be there 😁
