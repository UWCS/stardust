After a very relaxing (non-existent) reading week, I imagine we are all feeling REFRESHED and ready to LOCK IN this week. 😁

Remember that our AGM is coming up soon (26th Feb) and you can now nominate yourself to be exec of comp soc! (And also put forward motions to change things about the society) 🗳️

Being exec of a society is a lot of fun and a really good experience, so I would definitely recommend going for it if you're interested. 💜

You can find out what exec roles we have to offer [here](https://www.instagram.com/share/p/BAFEItMuEK). If you want to run for exec, please email president@uwcs.co.uk with your: full name, student ID, role(s) you're running for and an (optional) short description. The deadline to nominate yourself and put forward general motions is the **26th Feb** - constitutionally changing motions you have until the **19th Feb**! 🕘

Remember that our Welfare officers are always here to help you: Serene (@thiswasdumb on Discord) and Raven (@raven0034 on Discord).

I think that everybody will look *very* underdressed this week after the brilliance of **Formal Night Gaming**. Regardless, I hope to see you all there this week. I'm gonna lock in and get some new songs on Clone Hero so if you want any songs installed, let me know in the friday night gaming channel on Discord. 🎸
