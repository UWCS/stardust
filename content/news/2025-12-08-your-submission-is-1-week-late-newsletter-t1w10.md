Hi. Your assignment is not overdue. It's just a newsletter. I hope.

Anyways, This newsletter is special. IT'S A CONCOCTION OF 8 PEOPLE'S BRAINS. FEAT. OUR GREATT UWCS FREPS (+ BKB champion + secretaries). Enjoyyy the chaos that follows...

Jokes aside. It's the last week. Have fun and come to UWCS event :)

# Welfare Notice
UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Thomas (Discord: tomo.li) - good chance you've seen us around already with the exec hoodies on, but especially since we have a lot of new people, we want to make ourselves known. You can speak to us in-person, or message us over Discord, and we can help give you advice and signpost when you're going through stuff, whether that's trying to navigate the various support systems within the uni, or something has happened involving a member of the society e.g. at an event, and more. Starting uni can especially be quite overwhelming, just know we're here to help, and it's okay to not be okay!

**Additional Welfare Notice:** Christmas can be a difficult time for some. Since Raven is around, they'd be willing to run some low-key gaming sessions over the break so please get in touch with Raven (Discord: raven0034) if you're interested! Additionally, Raven will be around campus too during Christmas, so if you need any welfare, they'd be happy to help :)

# 🏀🏀 UWCS wins the WBL cup tournament 🏀🏀

When Jakub and Wenye started the CS basketball team, neither of them expected success in the team's first term in the WBL. However, the season got off to a strong start with a high quality turnout to the first basketball meetup. But would this translate to on-court performance? 

We were assigned to group D of the WBL, which had all the new teams. AND WE DOMINATED, going 4-0 in the group stage. Never has the WBL seen such domination. This put us in the play-offs for the WBL trophy tournament against multiple established dynasties. Unfortunately, we were knocked out early but still qualified for the cup tournament. 

We had reached the final. Us versus Spanish Soc. An intense back and forth ensued in the first half. Bucket for bucket. Foul for foul. Down 10 in the third quarter. And now, in the last seconds of the fourth, we found ourselves down 4. Whatever would we do? Like ChatGPT directing the job market, Wenye guided a contested 3 into the hoop for the AND ONE bringing us into overtime. Five minutes of blood, sweat and tears followed. However, our spirit stood steadfast and carried us to the win. 🎉  67 - 63. 🎉

After such a successful first season, where will CS go from here? From what I see, it's only up...

#### 🕖 Fri 12th Dec 3pm - (up to you)  📍 [CS0.07](https://link.mazemap.com/9DpsUFJF)
#### *Irene and Crystal's Termly video hehehe*

HELLO ALL
this is not your usual announcement.
no. this is a call.
a call to participate in the greatest video saga of all.
if you’re not aware of this saga (shame), feel free to watch [here](https://youtube.com/@giddyupglitch?si=HLXOnLOT0X-nOPai)

This term’s theme is ~~Speed Dating~~ *Speed Interviews* (for internships. yay.)‼️‼️

The video will have students interviewing with recruiters in a “speed dating”/“this video will involve mr. beast” vibe - and we’ll need as many of you as possible to play roles!! You can also still come hang out/help if you don’t wanna be filmed :)

Do we have a script you can look at? 
ha.
funny. 
no. we will not have a script until we’re done with coursework about 3 hours before the event. believe in us 💪

(you can also DM me if you wanna know a bit more about it - @eneri on Discord)

is there any reward for participating? you’ll be in DCS legacy forever 🔥 and you might be in the same video as a lecturer‼️

(and maybe free snacks - we’ll see)

# [🏃🏃‍♂️ Run Club 🏃‍♂️‍➡️🏃‍➡️](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/10/run-club/)
#### 🕔 Fri 12th Dec 5pm - 6pm  📍 [Outside DCS](https://link.mazemap.com/AD7fblJv)
#### *🎉 RUN LIKE SONIC 🎉*
Do you want to feel like you've earnt FNG? Then come to one of our **ESTEEMED WEEKLY RUNS**, open to all members and friends and family and friends of family and family friends of UWCS (had to make sure I was rigorous enough). An average week might look like a 5k around campus on a pre-planned route (pretending like I know what that means, definitely not just reading from the template; although we ought to discuss miles vs kilometers at some point, one is much more standardised and intuitive while the other just makes more sense -- 1km is just too short to feel like "one unit of long distance", perhaps we should bring back the league).

Since we are going into the second term for which this event is being run, we are still experimenting with new ideas each week. Run and juggle? Run like a maniac? Blame the tech freps when the printer doesn't work and run after them? WHO KNOWS!?

FOR ALL ABILITY LEVELS: No experience required, just show up and move legs!

**The boring bits:**
[Strava - UWCS Run Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1426021)

* Meet outside DCS at 17:00. Won't leave right away.

* Exec responsible are Zach (`doggy_w00f`) and Alfie (`brentfordarmy2398`)

* Unlike the Bluebell Barbecue on the Outdoor Events booking website, this event actually exists!!!

I've been told to mention how much Zach wants you to come. Come, else he will hunt you down and *make you run*.
- Vlad, your are Tech Frep since 2025

P.S. LET ME OUT I'M TRAPPED IN THE UWCS EMAIL SYSTEM
P.P.S. Call for a good time

# [👾🎮 Friday Night Gaming (7pm till LateTM) 🎮👾](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/10/friday-night-gaming-(7pm-till-latetm)/)
#### 🕖 Fri 12th Dec 7pm - 2am (at minimum)  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *GAMES, INFINITE GAMES, AND INFINITE BACON*
FREE SNACKS, DRINKS AND *GAAAAAAAMES!*
We did it again folks, we had FNG go on until midway through Saturday for *3 WEEKS IN A ROW!* Therefore, we have basically had *5 WEEKS OF LAN IN A ROW!*

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`), Sharvil (`w.0lf`) and our new *GAMING FREPS* Laina (`vomitspawn`) and Santiago (`colombian.`)  - come find us at any point if you need help, or even just to yap. We'll often be identifiable by our exec hoodies (or the freps, one identifiable by going insane on the Guitar Hero drums)

We have a TON of consoles and we don't expect you to bring anything (although you can if you want!). We have the *ENTIRETY* of CS0.03's computers to play games on (We have a Steam! Just ask a Gaming Exec to log you on), along with an Xbox, PS4, 3 Nintendo Switches (And a Switch 2!), *2* VR Headsets, 2 Guitar Hero guitars (GH5, Les Paul) *AND* A Guitar Hero drumset!
We have our Wii U HomebrewedTM thanks to our new NON-CONSTITUTIONAL MOTION! So feel free to hop on CTGP Revolution!

Tons of snacks too, just be warned that if I have a hand in it, there *WILL* be Dr. Pepper, whether you like it or not (•̀ ω •́ )✧

As is tradition too, we will set up [RAMPHI](https://ramphi.uwcs.co.uk) for anyone to join and add music that will TERRORISE anyone in DCS!

See you there, or else.

# [🍹🍺🍻 The 12 Pubs of Christmas - Pub Traversal 🍻🍺🍹](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/10/the-12-pubs-of-christmas---pub-traversal/)
#### 🕔 Sat 13th Dec 5pm - 10:30pm  📍 [Leamington Spa](https://maps.app.goo.gl/B2QsYskNv7mqv6YX6)
#### *mmmmmmm alcohol*
With the term coming to an end the opportunites for more socials are becoming few and far between but **DO NOT FEAR** UWCS is here with another **PUB TRAVERSAL**. Join us all for whats probably going to be the last event of this year (if you are on campus (pretty please be on campus :3)). We will be raiding 12(!!!) fine establishments (including the marvel that is Tescos, King amongst Pubs) for all the liquor they have on hand(optional) 

*Sober Execs:* Lyon and Sharvil

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*And now, finally... THE ALL THE SIGN OFFS 💯💯*

As T1 draws to a close, a **massive shout-out** to everyone who’s come along to the socials this term 🎉
You’re the ones who make them what they are, and I **can’t wait** to share what we’ve got planned for T2 👀

I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve gotta run — my favourite little CS118 robot is calling me back to bed.
And by “my favourite”, I of course mean that **cute, pointy frame** and **beautiful blue eyes** of our beloved petite sprite. 💙
The one that dances across my screen while whispering sweet nothings like:`Goal reached: False.` 😔 

-- odin *(the support main stuck between two DPS who’ve hard-muted each other)*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I haven't really done much frep'ing at all, what even is academia, I don't even think I've submitted a single assignment more than a day before the deadline. I'm just here for the secret locker access and free snacks. Also if at some point you hear about an event known as BONCS, pls come 🥺👉👈
-- Joseph ("academic" frep)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In other news, rumors of cryptids roaming the lovely humanties building (reports suggest a wendigo of some kind) capture my attention. Wish me luck in my returnal next term and join me in hoping I'm not consumed. S̸͑͌͋̄ê̷̩̗͐n̶̍̐̍̕d̵͎̍̅̋ ̶̉̎̊̕h̴͈͑̿e̸̋̃̓͘l̶̮̉̌̕ṕ̸̛̉̄

--B.Haria (they/them) (Your newly minted Treasurer Frep)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have an assignment due in tomorrow, I have 270 Anki cards due in today, I have sleep to catch up on thanks to FNG, and all I can do is sit behind my silly puter and type newsletters, and tell people to play Yume 2kki, read Subahibi and to listen to James Ferraro. I'm going insane and this is the time of my life.
@decatzo ftf
can i do sichikour

-- Laina (The triple gaming frep) (Still stuck fighting Four Devas Colonel)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just like Laina, I haven't done the Analysis 1 assignment, but that's fine because it's the last one so it doesn't count or something. Besides, I still have plenty of time. Time. Time? Where's time gone? It's the end of term already? No one told me that! Wait, 2026? What? Who-? Only last year I was learning to walk... Wait! That was 17 years ago? WHAT? I once looked up to the "big kids" at university, now you're telling me *I'm* one of them? How can I be trusted to be a role model to so many people? Soon I'll have to be a responsible adult -- WAIT I'M AN ADULT ALREADY? WTF!?!?!?!??!

Seriously, though, enjoy life, or something. Take it easy, whatever that means.

-- Vlad (your ~~friendly~~ "I've got enough friends" ~~neighbourhood~~ Rootes ~~tech frep~~ Maths impostor); Special mention to C+SS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Last but not least...*
Thanks for reading all our insane-ahh yaps for the entire term. We hope everyone has a great Christmas holiday!! 

*we will be back next term.*

*it's going to get worse*

*just saying*

-- Crystal and Ray (Your definitely very sane Secretaries)
