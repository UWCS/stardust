This is it. You've made it to the end of term! \*applause\* But you know what's not reached its end yet? Comp Soc events!

To celebrate *dragging* ourselves to the end of term, we're starting the week off with our **end of term meal** - please read below if you're coming as there is some important information!

We also will be at the **DCS XMAS social** which is always a lot of fun. Speaking of Christmas festivites, [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) has started this year! It's basically 25 programming problems leading up to Christmas, so is a good opportunity to practice. You can join our leaderboard using the code 316574-f9ecaa5c

On Thursday is **THE BIG ONE**. The Leamington pub traversal. Come and forget about the traumas of coursework just for a little while! :)

Finishing off the week, we have FNG and Basketball on Sports Sunday.

Massive congratulations to our newest addition to the **exec team** - **Luna**, our new **inclusivitiy officer**! I'm sure that you'll go a great job! :)

If you need any support, you can reach out to our welfare officers on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034) - they will direct you to the support that you need. :)
