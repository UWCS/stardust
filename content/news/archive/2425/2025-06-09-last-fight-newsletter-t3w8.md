If you read my recent newsletters (not the impostor ones), you'd realised that I've been fighting a war of life and death and I genuinely can't wait to ascend from the trenches also known as exam venues. Of course, I assume you all do as well. I don't know about you guys, but I like to breathe outside the trenches (UWCS events) once in a while. If you do as well, please come and all of us can breathe happily together because it's a human right to breathe I believe.

As always, we have our wonderful Welfare Officers here to help you if you encounter any issues: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034)

### You will need a [Circling Ticket](https://tickets.warwicksu.com/ents/event/26767/)
It's that time again  - another **UWCS circle**. This time it's gonna be **even MORE** of a banger. The theme is simple: **Wear your best circle outfit.**

That means that one **circle that you put a bunch of effort into**, we wanna see **that fit**. Maybe you went [**all out at our Smurfs vs Minions** circle](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/archive/2425/t1/w7/circle/), or the [BIG MEAL circle](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w3/big-meal-circle/), or maybe you had a **certy banger at a circle for another soc** 🤨 . If **you thought it went hard**, whip it out for one more ride. 🔂 

If all of your fits were rotters or this is your first circle, then your **fall back is wearing a bin bag.** 

There will be a **prize for the most impressive/creative outfit** of the night to reward those of you who **cooked** in your previous circles. 🎉 

As mentioned, we will be** in the Copper Rooms**, which means you'll need a **Circling + Event ticket from the [SU Website](https://tickets.warwicksu.com/ents/event/26767/) for week 8.** Make sure to grab one before they're gone!

__**Then afterwards, we go Pop!**__

🏆 **To signify how much of a *SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENT* it will be to finish this route** (and all ***15 PUBS*** therein 🍺🍺🍺...you get the idea) — Rowan will *personally* be buying the **WINNERS** an item of **fast food** 🍗🍟 from the one and only **SPICY BITE** 🔥🌶️.

Rules:
✅ You must have at least 1 alcoholic beverage in each pub 🍻.
❌ If you don't drink...
***YOU LOSE*** 😈.

Once again, hope everyone's exams have gone well with their sanity completely intact. I'm on the verge of it-- with tears and uncertainties in my future mixed with some flurries of confidence once in a while (genuinely can't believe some exams went decently well). Anywayyysss, good luck again with the remaining exams because we're all almost there. If you're one lucky ones who are out of the trenches, congratulations and enjoy the victory of all the hard work you've poured in until now :)) (On a side note, thank you fake secretary Raven for drafting 75% of this newsletter. You're the best.) - Crystal
