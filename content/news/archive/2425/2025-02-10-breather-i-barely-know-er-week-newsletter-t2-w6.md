I've finally finished all my assignments and interviews (thank god), and after a little day trip to London I am thoroughly exhausted. Why don't we get a reading week? Why must CS students be so hated? Who knows, but I think we're all well overdue a break. Instead, we're running EVEN MORE EVENTS this week, so I guess attending those is as close as we'll be getting to a break. Also, our AGM is in a little over 2 weeks, so remember to get your membership before the end of **Wednesday** to be eligible to vote! More details coming soon. 

Thank you to everyone who attended WASD - whether as a runner, commentator, helping out with tech (who deserve a SPECIAL thank you for their sacrifices), or just to watch - we raised £1,190 over the weekend for SpecialEffect, and we couldn't have done it without everyone on the day and in the months leading up to it <3

As term starts to pick up, a reminder that we have our usual welfare officers always here to help you: Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034)

# [🍺 Circle 🍺](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t2/w6/circle/)

#### 🕘Monday 10th Feb 8pm - Late📍[Ivy House -> Kasbah](https://maps.app.goo.gl/aDgmbryR5Kp9sq11A)
#### *No Monday Pub???*

Instead of our usual Monday pub meal this week, we have our white shirt circle at Ivy House. Remember to wear a white shirt you don't mind being graffitied, and a sharpie!

You can meet us at Ivy House at 8pm, or join us at TBar around 7:15pm where we'll be taking the bus into Coventry. As this isn't an on campus circle, no tickets are required!

# [🍔 Pub meal 🍔](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t2/repeat/pub-coach/)

#### 🕘Tuesday 11th Feb 7pm - 9pm📍[Phantom Coach](https://goo.gl/maps/wAptxmC4L7uajZEPA)
#### *I may not have a valentine, but at least I have alcohol*

Since we're going circling this Monday, our weekly pub meal has been moved to Tuesday (I would not advise drinking at pub if you come to circle). However, if like a certain Gamer™️, you're skipping circle, Phoach has an offer for a £5 bottle of wine if you buy two mains, so come and bring your valentine (or very good friend), or just buy two Mixed Grill platters to wash it all down*.

*Please eat and drink responsibly, even if you're spending valentines alone this year. It'll be okay.

This is our last week of the React course! Over the past weeks you've been learning how to build full-featured applications, and now you can round it all up with the final session. Don't forget,this course is PDP-able for first years!

# [🎮 Formal night gaming🎮](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t2/w6/fng/)

#### 🕘Friday 14th Feb 7pm - Late📍[CS Dept](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?slid=23888)
#### *CS students? A valentine?*

It's valentines day so love is in the air! Unfortunately, we're CS students so ~~almost~~ none of us have valentines - why not spend it with our gaming coordinators instead?

Exec may come dressed for the occasion, feel free to join us 👀

And don't worry, we'll still have our usual games set up for everyone to play. Who knows, maybe you'll find the one at FNG!
