Yo waddup, it's you're favourite ~~sleep deprived gamer~~ honorary secretary Finn here, here to deliver you news of the latest happenings of UWCS! Both of our secretaries Ray and Lucy are very busy at the moment (if you're 2nd year it's not hard to see why), so I thought *"why not"*, and am stepping in for them this week!

...What do you mean this newsletter's late? It always comes out on a Thursday! Wait, does it? Wait, it's not even Thursday! Oh no, my brain is seg-faulting just like my CS241 coursework!

In all seriousness, if it feels like things are getting a bit much, remember we have two lovely welfare officers that you can talk to about anything, Serene (Discord @thiswasdumb) and  Raven (Discord @raven0034).

#### *BELLOOOO!!*

Our social secs are bringing you all back into the SU Atrium for another awesome circle.

This week, the theme is **Minions vs. Smurfs**. Unfortunately, I'm not gonna be there as I didn't get a costume in time (and don't want to blue myself, props if you get that reference.).

I also heard that Rowan is bringing out the **NUCLEAR PUNISHMENT BUCKET**! What is it? What horrible surprises lie inside it? Hope that you don't find out for yourself!

#### *Don't talk to me about applications okay*

Qube Research and Technologies are doing a talk on Thursday! They'll be introducing who they are, what they do, and how **you** can get a job with them.

Oh yeah, and I heard there will be **free pizza** because I heard that tends to attract CS students. I wouldn't know.

This session is aimed for students curious about quant finance* and/or internship opportunities, so if this sounds like you we will see you there!

*Quant Finance - a branch of investment management that employs mathematical and statistical methods to analyse investment opportunities across a range of asset classes.

# [🎮 Friday night gaming w/ Mafia Soc 🕵️](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t1/repeat/fng/)

#### 🕘Friday 15th November 7pm-Late📍[CS0.03](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c888a421e6f5928c0d02b?projectId=warwick)
#### *I rolled a 1 for sanity check*

It's the usual plethora of consoles and PCs! Thanks to the wonderful work of Alex from our tech team, **we now have sound output from the DCS machines**! Perfect for all of you who play rhythm games at FNG.

Also, our amazing secretary Ray and frep gamer Rob helped us collab with Mafia to bring you a night of **Dungeons and Dragons One-Shots!**

It's been forever since I played D&D but I'm SO excited. If you're interested, sign up [here](https://forms.office.com/e/WEDbpS9aik) by **Thursday 10pm**. Be quick because slots are filling up rapidly (also I hear DMing for 10+ people is torture).

Mafia Society will also be bringing **a broad selection of non-computer games**, including Avalon, Coup (which is a banger), Secret Hitler, and much much more!

And uh... yeah there will be snacks.

I'm still recovering from LAN, and I don't think I've gotten a sufficient amount of sleep for the past two weeks. I imagine writing this newsletter isn't helping, but what can I say, I love to yap (which is evident if you've ever read my announcements)! Either way, hope to see you Friday night!
