Unfortunately *I* made some poor decisions this time and offered to write this newsletter - starting to wonder if I should start a UWCS podcast, especially after the successful analysis of the Citro√´n Ami and the Renault Twizy at WASD. Still, I could have made worse decisions on 20/04 of all days!

We've taken a bit of a break as a society, after all the insanity from bulk banana buying, repeated 5Ks, and Formal Night Gaming, and much more! But... now we're back for a *banger* of a term, and hey, maybe we'll make some more discoveries about dinosaurs this term, and get our Sports Officers to set up a velociraptor fight if we get the time machine working. And failing that, well... it's getting to the season where the geese around DCS do what they did last year: they [kindagotalittleangry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDjyhS2BQmk). Look out soon for the conclusion of the sticker contest on the Discord, because this may very well [become immortalised](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1361404478464458843/1361722411082317976/image.png?ex=680661d2&is=68051052&hm=a0f251096647b76cb5ed6d41910d8c608c91665360402f7b5e5cdefcf0913ced&) soon (HOOOOOOOOOONK)!

# Welfare Notice

As always, we have our wonderful Welfare Officers (hey, it wasn't me that originally said this) here to help you if you encounter any issues: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034). We're here for signposting and advice, and especially as we approach exam season, it's important you look after your wellbeing!

# Information about the ball

If you've bought a ticket, expect to hear from us, likely tomorrow, about seating preferences - after all, we always want you to have the best experience at our Balls (and hopefully a certain somebody does not play Jackie's Box!), so we're gonna do our best!


*Anyway*, maybe we got slightly off-topic, let's talk about this week's events!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [üçî Pub meal üçî](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/pub-coach/)

#### üïñ Monday 21st April 7pm - 9pm  üìç[Phantom Coach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xNJPdqHAV1bnoFjGA)
#### *No we're not just avoiding the Duck because of trauma from the geese*

Who lets a bank holiday get in the way of pub? Who lets term not even starting till *Wednesday* get in the way of pub? *No-one.*

The tradition must stand strong (and so must we!), and this is why we're venturing once more to Phantom Coach to kick off the term! We should have one of the side-rooms booked, so come join us in clearing out Phoach's ability to make Mega Mixed Grills, and catch us up with what happened over your break (or talk to us about velociraptors - apparently Velociraptor Awareness day (yes, a real thing, see [here](https://nationaltoday.com/national-velociraptor-awareness-day/)), happened on the 18th, so there's no better time of year!).

# [üéÜ UWCS x ADHDsoc Study Skills & Welfare Workshop üéÜ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w1/uwcs-x-adhdsoc-study-skills-welfare-workshop/)

#### üïì Tuesday 22nd April 4pm - 5pm üìç[OC1.04](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8942421e6f5928c0f4ee?projectId=warwick)
#### *Exams are coming... scary... anyway, how do you actually study, anyone know?*

We're bringing you a nice shiny collab with ADHDsoc as we enter exam season to give helpful ideas on how to revise and managing your wellbeing during a difficult time. Whilst this is a collab with ADHDsoc, all society members are welcome, however there are quite a lot of neurodivergent people within both societies (not me though, no paperwork /j), so we wanted to deliver this in a way that fits everybody the best we can! ~~After all, what are we doing with HD in the name if we're not delivering high-quality sessions.~~

Thankfully, writing this is giving me the reminder that I need add some more things to this workshop before we deliver it (probably nothing about velociraptors unfortunately - but maybe not a bad decision to write the newsletter after all!).

Come join us as we attempt to build you up into the exam answering *machines* that'll get you those sweet grades come the end of the year - and who knows, maybe you'll be set up more mentally for the geese and velociraptor fights to come!

# [ üèÉ UWCS Run Club üèÉ ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/uwcs-run-club/)

#### üïî Friday 25th April 5pm - 6:30pm üìç[Outside DCS](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8858421e6f5928c0c78f?projectId=warwick)
#### *Want to burn off some steam before, during or after steaming at Steam at FNG? We got you!*

We're gonna shock the world! Not only are we gonna be prepared with the facts on how to revise, but we'll be mentally *and* physically prepared for the gruelling term ahead. So the Sports Officers bring you: THE UWCS RUN CLUB!

The plan is to have weekly runs that anyone in UWCS can take part in, regardless of ability (and if you're being chased by rogue entities around campus [~~CHICKEN JOCKEY~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWQpiMd-v0A)). This is likely to be starting with a 5K around campus on a pre-planned route, but given this is a new event, expect to see a variety of ideas week-on-week! Meet Zach and Alfie outside DCS at 5pm to discover all the grass around campus and much more!

UWCS also now has a Strava that you can join [here](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1426021)!

# [ üéÆ Friday Night Gaming üéÆ ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/fng/)

#### üïñ Friday 25th April 7pm - 1am üìç[CS Department](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8858421e6f5928c0c78f)
#### *FNG: Flinging No Geese, much Friday Night Gaming*

We stopped eating spiders (for now), we started running, we carried on gaming, and you know what time it is? That's right! Time to continue the absolute best way to (almost) round-off a week! Whilst you may use Steam on the PCs to blow off some steam after running, please remember not to create real steam - as much as it would be cool to be a fire-breathing dragon, CS0.03 must remain intact for the FNG masterplan to continue! We will also make sure to put out the usual selection of consoles, so the usual battles of Mario Karts, Wii Sports (although I will not becoming out of my bowling retirement, in order to retain my 100% success rate) and much more can happen!

Please be aware that we're doing our normal idea of ending FNG at **1am** in order to accommodate exams. Us Gaming Coordinators probably know better than most that gamers are prone to extremely bad sleep schedules (and that's on top of the many CS/uni students' standard shitty sleep schedules!). Apologies for any inconvenience caused!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [ üìö CS130 Revision Session üìö ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w1/cs130-revision-session/)

#### üïï Saturday 26th April 6pm - 8pm üìç[MS.01](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c88f9421e6f5928c0e669?projectId=warwick)
#### *CS130: It has the potential to induce nightmares, but fear not! We got you covered*

As a conclusion to a somewhat hectic week back, UWCS once again brings you a CS130 revision session! From basic theorems all the way up to partial orders, countability and more, come join us for a late night shift in MS.01, and hopefully come away being ever more confident of conquering the beast known as *Mathematics for Computer Scientists 1*!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Best of luck with any upcoming exams! As with many unorthodox ideas, keep in mind getting in a fight with a goose, dinosaur etc, is a rather untested method of mitigating circumstances!
