Good evening everybodyyyyyy!! I hope that you've had a fantastic Christmas break and you are REFRESHED and ENERGISED for an absolutely FIRE term 2. 🔥

[Warwick Speedrunning (WASD)](https://warwickspeed.run/) is happening this term! It's a 2-day event where we raise money for charity by showcasing speedruns of games. If you want to get involved by submitting your speedrun (you don't have to be a pro!) you can do so [here](https://warwickspeed.run/signup), and you can [join the Discord here!](https://warwickspeed.run/discord) The deadline for submissions is next Sunday!

Bit of a quiet week to start with, but we've got more to come, trust me... 🤫

Remember that our Welfare officers are always here to help you: Serene (@thiswasdumb on Discord) and Raven (@raven0034 on Discord).

I've missed having an excuse to go to the pub every Monday whilst I've been at home for Christmas (I definitely wasn't doing it anyway). Pop by to the Duck on Monday for a much needed catch up with all your comp soc buddies. 🗣️
