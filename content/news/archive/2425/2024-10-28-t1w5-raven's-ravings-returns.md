It's been a while, but ladies, gentlemen and everything beyond, welcome to the next episode of Raven's Ravings with one of your resident Welfare Officers! Unfortunately our wonderful secretary Ray is injured so I have been tasked with writing this week's newsletter (get well soon Ray). This week has been very busy, from my research into clocks in Ethiopia - they have the 12 at the bottom instead of the top, it's very riveting - and discovering you can get a "backwards" clock off eBay for £15, to being brutally destroyed at Mario Kart 2 days in a row, at FNG and WHACK!

# Welfare notice

Remember, if things aren't going to plan that's okay! Whether you're homesick, feel out of place, or just generally struggling, we have our welfare officers **Raven** (@raven0034) and **Serene** (@thiswasdumb) to help you out and direct you to the right people.

Last week's pub meal incident is actively being followed up, and a full update can be found on the Discord [here](https://discord.com/channels/189453139584221185/378148494168555526/1300437742957760564) - if you need anyone to talk to regarding this, please feel free to reach out to us.

# Fresher Rep Nominations are open!

Until Friday 1st November 7pm, Fresher Rep nominations are open, for the following positions:

- Socials
- Inclusivity
- Gaming
- Academic
- Tech Officer

Interested in running (or perhaps sprinting if the competition is fierce enough?)? Send the following to **president@uwcs.co.uk**:

- Your full name
- Your student ID
- Which position you're running for
- A short description (up to 50 words) of why you're running and why people should vote for you - this is optional but we'd strongly recommend you provide this

**Please be aware we're not expecting you to come into the role with tons of experience, you'll work with the current exec to answer any burning questions you have (no you can't embezzle money or recruit people into a cult) and bring you up to speed.**

The election itself will happen in the DCS atrium at Friday Night Gaming, **where free pizza will be provided to attendees**. You'll be asked to give a short speech, and be open to questions afterwards. **You need to be a member of the society by the day of the election to stand.**

After this, voting will open at **8pm on 1st November** and will run until **8pm on 3rd November**, on [vote.uwcs.co.uk](https://vote.uwcs.co.uk/).

# A note on WHACK

Thank you to everyone that participated in WHACK, everything about the event exceeded our expectations, and it was great to see many bright minds come together to collaborate so well!

We also hope people enjoyed the social side of the event during the evening, where we had games, [made jokes about the clocks going back](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/189453139584221185/1300175027987288134/Compressed_WHACK.mp4?ex=67208a9a&is=671f391a&hm=365ca59530880ba3be98d992b7bfb0b27e784274c4a89b72a45455a92f7a09b4&), played [Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) at 4am, [I wore an octopus on my head](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/189453139584221185/1299905948835385354/AP1GczNWs0yH0tRBJiYtEYhNAtq4ukrFzcKkZKeqXn4cPGYwoZJGcR7w3j7aw660-h1173-s-no-gm.png?ex=672038c1&is=671ee741&hm=4fe92492ce9b06bcfa52cd5b16e2c16149fccf9695713c1049fb885c1ef1113e&), and for some reason somebody decided to devour an entire lettuce!

And finally, a massive shout out to people who volunteered, and especially the exec primarily involved in organising the whole event, including help from CodeSoc and Warwick AI exec, the event would not have been possible without you! (and a personal shoutout to the people doing the night shift with me, that was pure vibes!)

# [🍔 Pub meal 🍔](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t1/repeat/pub-coach/)

#### 🕘Monday 28th October 7pm - 9pm📍[Phantom Coach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xNJPdqHAV1bnoFjGA)
#### *Visit the site where a Tesco trolley mysteriously tipped over*

Got a long day on a Monday? Me too! After TA'ing the CS132 labs I will be absolutely exhausted and what better way to round the day out than a trip to the pub to get something to eat and talk about the most random topics known to people! (I hear there's a mystery prize for those who consistently attend pub too...)

*On a more serious note: I will be there in a Welfare capacity - please do not hesitate to come and talk to me or other available exec at any point if you are becoming uncomfortable/an incident is occurring.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [🌩️ Lightning Café 🌩️](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t1/w5/lightning/)
#### 🕘Tuesday 29th October 5pm - 9pm📍[OC0.05](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8941421e6f5928c0f4c4)
#### *tbf, you could talk about lightning... or toilets... or sprout-powered buses...*

They say the similarity is *striking* to a presentation, but that's what it is! Message one of the exec through the Discord server if you're interested in doing a Lightning Talk on something you're interested in, and come along on the day to learn about something interesting, whacky, or everything in between!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [🖥️ C Course 🖥️](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t1/repeat/c/)

#### 🕘Wednesday 30th October 5pm - 7pm📍[CS0.06](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c888a421e6f5928c0d038)
#### *C course - the Cend Off* 

The C course saga continues with the final session, open to anyone from any level. Missed the previous sessions? A link to the notes is on the society Discord! Hopefully everyone who has taken part has found the course useful ~~and is less likely to break keys off their keyboards from the sheer annoyance that C can provide sometimes~~!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [🐍 X-Soc Python Course 🐍](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t1/repeat/python/)

#### 🕘Thursday 31st October 7pm - 9pm📍[MS.01](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c88f9421e6f5928c0e669)
#### *is that a python are or are you just happy to see me*

We're now onto the fifth week of our Python course in collaboration with Warwick AI and CodeSoc! Whether you're learning Python for the first time or just want to get more practice, we're back this week in MS.01, and this time you don't just have to be scared of Python, because it's Halloween 🎃🎃🎃!

(who knows, maybe you'll spook your code into working...)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [🎮 Friday Night Gaming + Frep Elections 🎮](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t1/repeat/fng/)

#### 🕘Friday 1st November 7pm - Late📍[CS Department](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8858421e6f5928c0c78f)
#### *continuing the trend of frauding or being frauded with frantic items on mario kart*

As mentioned at the start, Frep elections will be held at FNG and there will be free pizza!

We'll get the consoles setup (and thanks to Finn, our holy Big O has been resurrected!), we'll play some games and unwind from the long week! Either play with friends or you can e.g. watch us get more worked up with each blue shell that gets sent our way :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, I must sleep some more. Peace out, from your totally sane Welfarer, Raven :3
