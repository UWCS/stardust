It's about time I wrote a newsletter... how long has it been? Well, good news I'm off hiatus and back to fuel the brainrot!

If you haven't been going to lectures, and instead you've been playing video games, usually I'd tell you that's a bad idea - but for once you can put your crippling video game addiction to good use, as the Warwick Speedrunning submissions deadline has been EXTENDED! The new deadline is Friday 17th January at 23:59, and you can submit your runs [here](https://oengus.io/marathon/wasd2025)

Last week was quiet for a reason... it only gets crazier from here.

And just as a reminder, we have our usual welfare officers always here to help you: Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034)

If you want to drown your sorrows of yet another term with ~~alcohol~~ food, join us from 7pm!

Sessions cover topics such as components, JSX, state, lists, keys, forms, side effects, data fetching, and references.

If Monday night pub doesn't fill the hole in your heart with alcohol, this sure will. And if you don't drink, in (probably) the words of our social secs, "that's not an excuse either". Remember the theme is anything but clothes, which is brave in *January*, but please don't come naked.

We'll be going to pop afterwards, and as always there will be sober exec present to deal with any problems!
