Welcome back to another episode of your favourite weekly newsletter, coming direct from UWCS' sanest member of exec. 

Hopefully term hasn't hit you too had yet ~~other than you robot maze enjoyers~~, but if it has we have plenty of events to distract you from all of your most pressing responsibilities.

We also have an update for **WHACK**! If you were unable to get a ticket when they released, we now have a waitlist. The form is [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=vc-6Ce9HZUSSZTVG8ur2vFkVXfvhxitPuOtwU2_MTMdUNDFWRTNYOE9NRDNUM0ZOSzVTQVNFMjhZWC4u), and if we get any ticket refunds these will be distributed on a first come first serve basis. 

And remember, if things aren't going to plan that's okay! Whether you're homesick, feel out of place, or just generally struggling we have our welfare officers **Raven** (@raven0034) and **Serene** (@thiswasdumb) to help you out and direct you to the right people.
