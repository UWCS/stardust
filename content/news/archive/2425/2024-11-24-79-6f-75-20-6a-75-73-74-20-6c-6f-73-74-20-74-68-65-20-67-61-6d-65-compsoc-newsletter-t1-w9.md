Evening everyone, it's your favourite ~~President~~ Secretary trying to 100% the exec roles (only frep and gaming left now), so I'll be writing the newsletter this week.

We've not got a lot planned, but rest assured we're going to go out with a bang next week (more details released soonTM)!

Also: we're running a by-election for a new Gender Inclusivity officer - if you're interested in running some events targeted towards our gender minority group (Wildcards) send your name, student ID and a short description to `president@uwcs.co.uk` before the election this Friday.

If you need any support, you can reach out to our welfare officers on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034) - they will direct you to the support that you need.
