## 👾 Comp Soc Newsletter 👾 | Newsletter T1 W6

Good evening all! Can't believe it is already November - basically Christmas.

As the evenings get _colder_ and _darker_, and **coursework season** starts to KICK in, it's important to come to comp soc. This week we are running a **LAN**, where we spend the **weekend gaming**. You can find more details about the LAN below. There is also **Sports Sunday** which is **Badminton** this time. :)

I also want to say a massive congratulations to the new **fresher reps**. We are all _very excited_ to see what you do for the society!

If you need any support, you can reach out to our welfare officers on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034) - they will direct you to the support that you need. :)
