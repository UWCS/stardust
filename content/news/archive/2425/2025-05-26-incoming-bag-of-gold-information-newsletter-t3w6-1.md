I think I can see the light at the end of the tunnel... 2 more weeks left of war and then we're freeee. But of course, in the midst of uncertainties (of what's gonna show up on the papers), we have a great array of events for you whenever you want to take a break from the grind and just chill with your friends.

As always, we have our wonderful Welfare Officers here to help you if you encounter any issues: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034)

The gap between the digital skills required by employees, and those demonstrated by graduates has been much reported on. This leads to the key questions: How can a University department best equip its students to enter a workforce focused on evolving technological demands?

As part of a wider piece of work across 7 UK Universities, we’d like to invite both staff and students to a workshop aims to gain insight on the expectations of graduates, and the effectiveness of teaching and assessment within the sector. 

The feedback gathered at this workshop will help to provide actionable advice to support graduates in being work-ready, and how to aid programme delivery to achieve that goal.

Lunch will be provided.
