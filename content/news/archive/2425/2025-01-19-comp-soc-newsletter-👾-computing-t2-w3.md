HELLO ALL! As forewarned, the time has **FINALLY COME**. The first few weeks were reasonably quiet but this week is JAM PACKED with *a ton* of cool Comp Soc events so be sure to get stuck in!

Speaking of jam, **The Great Warwick Game Jam** starts on Wednesday at 2pm in MB3.17. You can get more information about that and sign up [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/game_jam/)!

We're also doing a programming competition (and prep session for it) this week, so check it out if that's your thing. :) 

Remember that our Welfare officers are always here to help you: Serene (@thiswasdumb on Discord) and Raven (@raven0034 on Discord).

I was gonna quack a duck joke here, but all the ones I googled were actually so bad - who came up with this??: "What do you call an exploding duck? A firequacker" 🦆💥

Regardless of the lack of good duck jokes, pub meal will still commence at The Dirty Duck this week.

#### *Golf with your friends IRL??*

At first, I was disapointed when I learnt that pub golf does not involve playing golf. HOWEVER, I was thrilled to learn that drinking is involved. 🍷

You can either meet us at The Clarendon in Leamington Spa at 7pm, or meet at the UW5 stop at the bus interchange at 6pm, where we will get the U1 or U2. Come along for some fun games, and learn what Pub Golf actually is (I still don't really know but it's gonna be epic)!!

Have a lovely week 3 :)
