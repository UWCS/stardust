no more milk? what has the world come to...

<!-- more -->

Yes friends and enemies, we have decided that it is not really worth having *Milk Monday™* every week, so it will now be occurring on the first Monday of each month. 

I am very sorry for the sadness this may inflict, especially during these tough times of coursework and the desire for calcium for stronger bones as you program away.

Despite this, WE'VE GOT OUR CLASSIC EVENTS FOR THE WEEK: *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe*, and *FNG*.

We also have **two** new events just for this week: *Advent of Code* to celebrate the beginning of December, and a *Blender Workshop* for all of the third-years who made the interesting decision to take Computer Graphics (i'm sure it is a lovely module)

Pretty chill week, so you can relax and get some free snacks from our events whilst you work away on your assignments :)

Yes indeed. It is December. We have reached the final month of the year, and the final few weeks of the term.

**HOWEVER,** we are computer science/DCS/STEM/whatever the heck you are students, and so we will do __Advent of Code__ this year!

Choose your favorite programming language and jump into some *fun* challenges this month to test your knowledge and approaches to various questions :)

We are hosting this event for the **first** programming challenge of the month, so don't miss out!

Coursework? Why do it now when you've got plenty of time to procrastinate it until the night before???

We have tons of consoles and games you can play around with if you want (or need) a break! Steam, Jackbox, Wii, Rockband and more!

Stop by and enjoy our weekly FNG with us! (*also, we will be providing free snacks so just take some*)

We hear all the CS324 students crying, we know the pain you are going through.

Don't you worry! We are working alongside *Warwick Game Design* and *Warwick Content Creation Society* to offer you a quick session on how to get into Blender (the answer for basically your entire coursework).

This workshop will start from an introduction to 3D modelling all the way to advanced techniques so you can impress Shan will all of your snazzy skills! :)
