**HOWEVER,** we've still got tons going on so don't be consumed by the inevitable stress just yet!

We've got those weekly classics, like our *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe*, or *Friday Night Gaming* that allow you to enjoy the food, vibes, and people!

We've also got our AGM this week! Elections are coming up so if you're interested in an exec position please do run!

There's also a few awesome talks going on this week, so it might be worth checking them out (especially you first-years).

ALSO, ALL FINAL YEAR STUDENTS PLEASE FILL OUT THE [NATIONAL STUDENT SURVEY](https://www.thestudentsurvey.com/)!! your say matters, and it only takes a few minutes!
