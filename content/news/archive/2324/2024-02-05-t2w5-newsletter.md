Anyways, yeah I just did that because it's already been a long week and its Monday, SO LET'S SET REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS!

*It's week 5 already oh my gosh what the heck is going on.*

Although, it is the first Monday of the month, and so we are having our **first** Milk Monday of the term!

Along with this, we've got our weekly classics: *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe*, and *Friday Night Gaming* for some free drinks and snacks, and even some chats (i've reused this so many times im sorry im a bit lazy)

It is also worth noting WASD happened this past weekend and the Computing Society raised over 1600 pounds for the charity Special Effect! A big thank you goes to the Esports Centre for supporting us with PCs and being extremely helpful overall. Also, a giant thank you to both Keegan and Owen for helping out so much. Massive appreciation to everyone who attended, helped, or even just watched online. You are all appreciated :)

Our typical pub meal is going on, and we are going to the all time favorite of *Phantom Coach*

Regardless, come on over for some bites and chats with all of us (especially 2nd years who just submitted software engineering!)

*We will meet and walk together from DCS at 6:05pm if you'd like to join us!*
