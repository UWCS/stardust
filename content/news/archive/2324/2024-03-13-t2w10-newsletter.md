THIS IS IT. THE END OF MY NEWSLETTERS!

<!-- more -->

The final newsletter with all the key points needed before the handover to the new official secretaries.

SO I AM GOING TO JUST PUT WHATEVER I KIND OF WANT INTO THIS ONE!

**Anyways,** we've got some pretty cool events going on this week that you might like to check out :D

**NO** pub meal for example, instead we have our *End of Term* meal (a fancier version of pub meal ig)

We've also got our **FINAL** circle of the term (wtf it's basically after term ends technically but who cares), SO YOU SHOULD CONSIDER COMING ONCE WE FINISH UP THIS TERM (but also yeah assignments exist so good luck)

And we have got our typical weekly classics of: **Comp Café** where we will all be stressing our minds out because of stuff due too soon and **Friday Night Gaming** to finally relax once this term ends because wtf is the amount of coursework due now

YEP YEP SO THAT IS ALL FOR THE TERM, ENJOY EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT, THIS NEWSLETTER IS LATE AND IM SORRY

WE ARE STILL GOING WITH THE COURSEWORK GRIND, I CANNOT LIE.

IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT, BUT I BELIEVE EVERYONE IS POWERING THROUGH. SUBMIT THOSE ASSIGNMENTS, DO THOSE PRESENTATIONS, GIRLBOSS, GATEKEEP, GASLIGHT THE ASSIGNMENTS AWAY AND I BELIEVE IN YOU ALL.

We will have snacks and drinks available in the common room! There will also be free coffee from the vending machine until 7pm!

Come and work or talk to friends and just get all of the stress out of your system because i know i need to!

## **[🌮 End of Term Meal 🌮](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t2/w10/eot-meal/)**
**🕔 Thu 14 Mar 7pm - 10pm  📍 SHIN Japanese Kitchen & Bar**  
さようなら、青い蘭！

That's right! We've decided to change venue this term and we're going to be eating Japanese for this end of term meal! 

As always, we'll be meeting on campus beforehand so we can all travel to the venue together :)

I feel like it's been a very exhausting term for students and staff alike so why not take a little time to chill with the rest of your tired peers and relax a little bit at the end of term :D

THERE IS A LIGHT AT THE END OF THIS TUNNEL YOU'VE GOT THIS!!!!!!
