We've got our weekly classics: *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe* (also in collaboration with BioSoc for a gaming night!), and *Friday Night Gaming* for some free drinks and snacks, and even some chats.

**However,** we've also got **Week 4 Circle + Pop**. Buy your circling ticket, dress up as a tech CEO, and join us for a night of fun! *Be there or be square*

**Also,** this weekend we are holding our annual event of Warwick Awesome Speedruns and Demos! WASD is an amazing student-run event in which students speedrun various games and all funds accumulated are donated to Special Effect. Check it out in real life or online if you can!
