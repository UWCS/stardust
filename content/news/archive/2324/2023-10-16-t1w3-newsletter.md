This week is freaking packed. We have tons of events for you to check out, so make sure you keep your eyes out (we even have a three-day long event! 👀)
Consider checking out our first *Loud and Proud* social of the year! Or maybe listen to our first set of *Lightning Talks* (topics to be announced asap!). Make sure you pass by the *Ada Lovelace Day* celebration in collaboration with Warwick Maths and Statistics societies (there is free food, come on)! This is just a taste of all the amazing things we have planned this week, so scroll down and look at what you might be interested in :D

I hope you are all having an amazing week and don't get too stressed yet! Relax and enjoy the term :)
