LAN IS OVER, TIME TO SURVIVE WITH OUR RUINED SLEEP SCHEDULES !!

<!-- more -->

We are nearly halfway through term, and we are still pushing through lads (and lasses and non-binary  ̶b̶a̶d̶a̶s̶s̶e̶s̶).

Don't let the fact we are so far into term make you forget about our typical weekly events we have going on! Grab some free milk from *Milk Monday*, or study with some fall-themed snacks at *Comp Cafe*! You definitely can't forget our *Friday Night Gaming*, especially when we just wrapped up LAN.

Everyone is slowly becoming busier, so this week is more relaxed. Make sure you pass by and enjoy some of our events :)

**ALSO,** if you are reading this far and you are a fresher, consider running for fresher rep in our week 5 FNG. The link for signing up can be found [here](go.uwcs.co.uk/rep)

Everyone is starting to get coursework (yes first years, i see you), and what better way to get a move on with it then some free milk! You need some calcium in order to get those brain cells working >:)

However, we do not give up! We will be making our way to *Dirty Duck* for our weekly pub meal :D
