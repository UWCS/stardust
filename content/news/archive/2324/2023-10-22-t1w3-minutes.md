## AGENDA I: Advertising For Applications & For Event
- Need to decide on colour scheme so we can get proper announcement out
  - Colour scheme
    - Blue ⇐ Red/Orange ⇐ Purple/ish
    - Purple is liked, pattern needs to be changed up
      - Don’t like the circles
      - See if circuit pattern works, go with purple
    - Coral pink + pastel blue ⇒ (pastel pink, baby blue?)
  - Change anything big about event that should be notified
  - Venue ⇒ SU Atrium is good
- **TO DO:** _Announcement out by the end of next week (November 3rd)_
- **TO DO:** _Decide on colour scheme and final WASD design beforehand_
- Eventually put together website
  - Pretty quick just mainly CSS changes
    - Update photos on website soon
    - **Doing it on 3rd/4th of February ⇒ Week 4 of term 2**
      - Week of February where there is barely any clashes

## AGENDA II: Talking to Big Screen and SU

- **TO DO:** _Email SU to book Atrium_

- **TO DO:** _Email SU Tech guy (Jack Denton) ⇐ Samit_
  - Make him aware of it and see what SU can potentially provide for the day

## AGENDA III: Venue
- SU Atrium

## AGENDA IV: Call for Runners
- Going to make call for runners when design was finalised ⇒ original plan was end of week 4
  - Announce and call later or announce and call now
    - If announce without call, put date in announcement so people know when
  - Originally done last year at end of week 10, too late
- **TO DO:** _Announce WASD end of week 4, finalise website and call for runners’ interest end of week 5 until week 8, then week 8 request for a video of runs and close term 2 week 1_
  - Gives three weeks to make schedule and judge runs
  - Judge based on can we put donation incentives (get people engaging with run), how impressive it looked (mechanical/vibes), how good it was relative to best time, length of run (short runs in prime time, longer ones are other spots ⇒ cut longer runs if too many)
    - Morning ones are just filler

## AGENDA V: Commentators
- Have one person who knows game and one who doesnt
  - eSports has commentators
  - Don’t want anyone to do the whole thing
  - Get some runners to do commentating
- One commentator who knows what's going on and explains well and one who doesn’t know so they ask appropriate questions and is also kind of entertaining
  - Can get someone on discord since a lot will know about the game and was done previously
  - Noah in CASP server is very much interested in commentating
- No remote runners

## AGENDA VI: Stretch Goals
- Keegan and/or Samit shaves his head
- **Commentate in hot tub ⇒ censor out hot tub (maybe depending on twitch TOS)**
- Joel spice again? or other food
- Someone wears a maid dress (then cat girl)
- Alia eats an entire onion
- Run specific goals again
- Funny number?
- Bonus game ⇒ reach certain amount of money and add another game to schedule

## AGENDA VII: Collaborations
- Nintendo soc ⇒ interested in helping out in some way but not in a specific manner
  - Advertising they can be helpful with, plenty of speedrunning with nintendo games
  - Commentators would be useful
  - We don’t need more people in terms of specific organising
- Mine soc to get someone to speedrun Minecraft
  - Callum volunteered to speedrun Minecraft (maybe)
- Warwick AI ⇒ get automated speedrun would be hella cool
  - Can just get a TAS (tool assisted speedrun) anyway - WAI might be dead
- Get filler segments between down time of runs
  - Ashe set up games properly last time, this time we don’t have access to esports nearly as much
- Contact companies for items to give away ⇒ special effect, big potato games?
  - (Czech Games Edition Playground Games Jackbox Games Two Point Studios Overly Sarcastic Productions Big Potato Games Special Effect) ⇐ contact for giveaways potentially + Leam gaming (Rebellion, Playground)
  - People who donate (5 quid puts you in marble run and random one will win) are automatically entered
  - People can donate and changes colors and such on the stream (make funny things happen)
- Anisoc
  - Advertise, Arman said he would down to help

## AGENDA VIII: Tech Setup
- Esports ⇒ Ella is rep at center for WASD, we have four computers, all infrastructure should be similar because we are in Atrium again
  - We had five computers last year
  - **TO DO:** _Request one more computer ⇐ Samit_
- **TO DO:** _Joel gets mixer surface_
- Owen is going to redo a bit of OBS and mixer stuff ⇒ put ESA stuff into ours
  - Owen will take mixer at some point
- Donations were fucked up last year and multiple appeared at once
  - Owen says they should be fixed by now, Tiltify should be updated because they had broken some endpoints with API
  - **TO DO:** _Check beforehand to ensure everything is working_
- Have an approval queue so donations can be checked
  - Donations on screen and going through a buffer
  - We do not refund and we put rules saying certain things can’t appear

## AGENDA IX: Game Selection Panel
- Samit, Mat, Keegan, Callum offered to be on selection panel and see which runs should be selected
  - Keegan offered to be in a run if needed
  - **Add donation incentive to remove/change current commentator (10 to 20 quid)**
  - Keegan said start with very small incentives so people can pay and then gets the ball rolling

## AGENDA X: Timescales
- End of Week 4, announce WASD
- End of Week 5, register interest (can submit videos early)
- End of Week 8, end register interest, get videos of speedrunners until January  8th
- Term 2 week 2, get schedule up by end of it + donation incentives (can be delayed), have runs accepted beforehand so they can finalise journey (faster better, ideally end of week 1)
