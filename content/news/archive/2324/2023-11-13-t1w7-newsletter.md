what happened to being an academic weapon....

<!-- more -->

This was meant to be the term where nothing would stop us, and yet at week 7 I would like to just go home and nap whenever I can.

**DESPITE THIS,** WE DO NOT STOP OUR EVENTS, SO YOU BETTER PUSH THROUGH (especially for the free snacks)!

We've got our classics of: *Milk Monday*, *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe*, and *Friday Night Gaming*. You know them all. You love them all. 

ALSO, we have new Fresher Reps! You voted for them (if you're a fresher, sorry boomers), so please congratulate them if you see them. We are happy to have them on board :)

I've seen all of you waiting for milk at our classic Milk Monday, I now believe there are people who willingly drink a cup of milk in the morning.

*Watch out, this week the newly elected fresher reps will be handling the milk business!*

Phantom Coach is a classic for our weekly pub meal! Grab some food and relax with us after the (arguably) worst day of the week.

*As per usual, we will be meeting at DCS around 7pm so we can walk over to Phantom Coach together*

Yeah, this is still happening. You are probably stressing about assignments (I see you third years with compilers coursework) and you are almost definitely just sitting in the labs or your room and typing away. Why not get some free snacks while you're at it? You'll probably meet someone else also stressing about the same assignment!

Pass by and grab some snacks (or even just some free vending machines drinks) :)

*i hope you said no, but i am almost sure a portion of you would say yes to that question 💀*

Regardless, we have tons of consoles and games you can play around with if you want (or need) a break! Steam, Jackbox, Wii, Rockband and more!
