Dear reader, I really doubt the title looked realistic as an assignment, but y'know I tried. Also, do note that the module number is basically just the date

<!-- more -->

**However,** it is a good reminder that we are already in week 3, and so we have some great events going on this week you should check out!

There are, of course, our weekly classics: *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe*, and *Friday Night Gaming* for some free drinks and snacks, or just a fun time.

**There is also** a **Docker Workshop** where we will be helping you first-years get your PDP points, or you second-years get on with your softwate engineering projects.

**Also,** look out for the **Great Warwick Game Jam**! It is an amazing event for those interested in video game design (with speakers from the industry coming in), and there *may* be a cash prize for the winners.
