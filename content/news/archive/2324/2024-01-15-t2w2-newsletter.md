i hardly know what's going on in my lectures, so sorry about that Aristotle 🙄

Welp, we are in week two of term. This feels like it has been going both too fast and too slow.

**REGARDLESS,** we have tons of awesome events going on (and by awesome i mean the typical ones we have).

We've got all th weekly classics: *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe*, or *Friday Night Gaming* for some free drinks and snacks, or just a fun time.

**There is also** a __Pub Traversal__ (yes you heard that correctly folks, a *traversal* ~~not crawl~~). We will be exploring Leamington, so why not join us?

Computing students going around bars in Leamington, that's mad :o

Okay, the location *may* have changed suddenly last week. 

**However,** for our second Pub Meal of the term, we are heading over to the Dirty Duck on campus to enjoy some food and drinks! Pop by and relax for a bit :)
