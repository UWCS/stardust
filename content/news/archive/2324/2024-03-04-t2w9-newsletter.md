We love Oscar wilde

<!-- more -->

**Anyways**, we've got some special events this week! 

Coursework is a pain in the butt (i cannot swear in these i think), SO WE CAN PLANNED A COMP CAFE ALL NIGHTER!

We know how much you guys work during Comp Cafe (because we definitely work a ton), AND SO LET'S CONTINUE THAT GRIND ALL NIGHT!!!

Aside from that, we've got the classics of pub meal and FNG, so **don't** miss out on those

And, of course, we have our FIRST MONDAY OF THE MONTH TRADITION!! (milk monday yippiee!)

Finally, Samit has basically helped me write this entire newsletter and upon his request, PLEASE GO LISTEN TO **LOVELESS** BY *MY BLOODY VALENTINE*

(also oliver wrote the title, so credit to him)

BUT DO NOT PANIC, OUR ACADEMIC COORDINATORS ARE HERE TO SAVE THE DAY AND GET YOU THAT FIRST (hopefully)!

This CompCafe, we're going to be going ALL NIGHT!!!

In addition to the usual snacks and drinks we have, we'll be doing a takeout food order at 7pm (similar to our regular orders every week at FNG) and Monster / free coffee / hot chocolate will also be avaliable during the night :D

IT'S GOING TO BE OK!!! - we'll absolutely demolish those courseworks n deadlines over the course of the night and be absolutely raring to go the next day!!!! (please nap if you feel drowsy!!)

Friday night gaming returns once again this week with all the snacks,games and music you've grown to love (Duvet by Boa)

As always, we'll be setting up our Rock Band, Wii U, PS4 and Xbox One in the Atrium and Hardware Labs! Personally, I'm excited to play Tekken 8 with everyone since I've been cookin a nasty Asuka in the lab for a while now B)

If you get time - why not stop by for a while :D I think by Friday we'll know our new exec team so it could be a great opportunity to get to know them in a more casual setting :)
