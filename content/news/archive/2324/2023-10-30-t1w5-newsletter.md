We are halfway through the term, what the 🦆

<!-- more -->

To be fair, so much has happened in the term so far! We have hosted a ton of events and there are tons more planned, so I am quite excited :) (i also hate how many times i used the word "so" in the past two sentences wtf)

ANYWAYS, we have plenty of great events this week! We have our usuals: *Milk Monday*, *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe*, and of course *Friday Night Gaming*!

We also have a few unique ones you should definitely look out for! *Circling* is happening this Wednesday, with a good theme for whichever celebration you're most prepared for :D We also have our second-to-last *xSoc Python Talk* happening, so attend while you still can! Finally, we have our **first** *EGM* happening during Friday Night Gaming.

We have plenty for you to attend this week, so you better try to attend one >:)

## **[🥛 Milk Monday 🥛](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t1/w5/milk/)**
**🕔 Mon 30 Oct 10:30am - 11:30am  📍 [DCS Atrium](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk//search/623c8858421e6f5928c0c78f)**

This is such a genuine question, because I do not I understand who is actually just drinking milk because they want to. You add it to things, like cereal or chocolate powder to get chocolate milk or hot chocolate. 

*Unless,* you are one of the people who actually enjoys it, then you should totally just turn up to **Milk Monday** and drink all of the free milk you'd like!
