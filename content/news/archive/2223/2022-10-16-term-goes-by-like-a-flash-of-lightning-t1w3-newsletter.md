<p data-block-key="sfd3i">Our first set of Lightning Talks, and our Python &amp; Rust courses are continuing!</p>

<!-- more -->

> We have the return of Lighting Talks for this year! Where we fit a range of short educational talks into (hopefully) an hour! Our courses are continuing as usual this week, with Week 3 of 6 of the xSoc beginners Python Course on Tuesday, and Week 2 of 4 of our more advanced Rust Course on Thursday. Both great opportunities that you don‚Äôt want to miss! Of course, we also have our regular Pub Meal and Friday Night Gaming!

For experienced programmers. Learn one of the most loved languages by developers! This week will dig into some of the more unique parts of Rust: borrowing and starting on traits. We'll get you started on CHIP-8 as well!

With the support of a grant by the Rust Foundation, we'll be guiding you through what makes Rust stand out from the crowd, and get hands-on with some projects. First, Tic-tac-toe. Next, a Chip-8 Interpreter. Finally, a Graphics Raytracer built from the ground up. Not to be missed!

Join us Friday for a night of fun! With a ton of games and consoles, plus our VR setup. I don't quite know what happened last week, but it can't have gotten worse. All I know is it lasted until 4am, and this ending time is getting increasingly theoretical.

In other news, I've been busy adding games to GamingGet, our lovely free game system, come along and give a few a go!
