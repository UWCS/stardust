<p data-block-key="sfd3i">Computing Ball Tickets &amp; WASD: Our speedrunning event!</p>

<!-- more -->

> We have some exciting stuff this week! Our Ball has finally been announced, it will be in the awesome Riverside Glasshouse, on Saturday of term 3 week 2, so just after the first set of exams! Tickets will go on sale tomorrow!
>
> [WASD](https://warwickspeed.run) is finally happening! I may be a little biased, but it's gonna be a great weekend! If you want to see how much fun, have a look at our [tech diagram](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/605142986313040086/1071823384251482112/image.png) -- absolutely nothing to go wrong. But in all seriousness, this WASD has actually been well prepared for, so drop in in the SU Atrium or on Warwick Esports' Twitch!
> 
> The membership deadline for the AGM next week has passed, but you can stand for any of the positions right up until the event! We have a couple of candidates for most positions now, but don't let that stop you, because we'll certainly be taking at least a couple of people for a lot of them. If you want more information on the positions, check [our Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CoUgu25txHq/).

## **[☕ CompCafé W5 + CS262 Revision](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/compcafe-22t2w5/)**
**🕔 Tue  7 Feb 5pm - 9pm  📍 [CS0.01](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1557)**  

As promised, we're also starting to do revision sessions! 2nd Years have class tests coming up, so here's what's happening:

- This CompCafé (Week 5): CS262 Logic & Verification class test prep from 7pm
- Next CompCafé (Week 6): CS259 Formal Languages class test prep from 7pm

The idea is to walk through some of the more challenging questions and topics, as well as offer some tips. We understand that today's one is pretty short notice, but we hope you'll find them both useful. If you have any suggestions for what you think we should focus on, let us know!
