<p data-block-key="sfd3i">Lightning Talks, Pub Crawl, DCS&#x27;s Game Jam, what&#x27;s not to love?</p>

<!-- more -->

> And I'm back! I'm sure you missed these standard newsletters after whatever last week's was. We've got some cool stuff this week: the start of DCS's two-week game jam, and our lightning talks shortly after the game jam's keynote.
>
> We are also just under two weeks away from our membership cut-off to vote in our upcoming elections, so get yourself and your friends registered. If you are receiving this by email, congrats, you are signed up!
>
> Only a couple more things to pester you about: our server infrastructure is still under maintenance (who knew a bunch of mostly worryingly old servers had problems?), and WASD 2023 has [a released schedule!](https://oengus.fun/wasd2023/schedule)
>
> Without further ado, our newsle- wait, a sponsor spot?!
