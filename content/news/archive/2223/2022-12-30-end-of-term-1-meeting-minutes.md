        - Owen had meeting about tech yesterday
        - Some tech we’ll need, but mostly things we’ll need to buy at some point anyway

## Elections

- W6 Fri for elections
    - Someone needs to figure out UWCS Vote
    - And someone to run (returning officer)

## Ball

- Term 3 week 3
- Some people questioning DCS involvement
		- Want to retain full control
    - DCS money needs to be spent on campus
    - Can't hurt for publicity
- People
    - Preya doing WFS ball and Skiros involved in Pride
				- Can borrow some info
    - Mia or Angelica lead commitee
    - Alex, Joey, Owen (probably others) happy to help somewhat
- Subsidise? Skiros thinks is ok, despite usual reading of SU rules?
    - SU rules say event has to break even or profit
    - The general reading is that tickets have to pay for the whole event
    - Skiros’ interpretation is that the SU has to break even, but UWCS funds could contribute to that

### Location

- Village Hotel (Cov), Chesterford Grange (food bit mid - skiros), glass house leam (cyber was there, was underwhelming, but v. pretty location (needs decorating tho))
- Warwick Castle - expensive af @Skiros  check pride’s price tomorrow
- Leam Pump Room: v nice
- Look at warwick castle, riverside glass house, pump room for 50-60 people
    - Maybe up to 100+
    - Likely more people interested than we think

## Social

Events next term:

- Circle W1 TBar then Pop
- W3 circle as well?
- Chemsoc joint social?
- Bletchley park again?
- Ice skating - but expensive

## Publicity

- Obviously, everyone’s busy, but publicity has been going out a bit late
    - Partly due to publicity not being too proactive
    - Partly being event detailed only finalized last minute
- Brendan proposes Publicity restructure a bit
    - Andreea to do schedule
    - Brendan do *special* events graphics
    - Ella for some more story + routine stuff
    - Inter-publicity comms hasn’t been great
- Process in person pics
- Meeting over christmas

# (Academic) Retrospective

- Welcome week went v well
- Python course when decently, but we pulled more weight
    - Very good initial attendance - drop off W3 - 20-30 people last week
    - Certificates to go out @Keegan Rimmington
- Rust course was very good
    - Maybe add slightly more guidance on the Rust way of doing things
    - CHIP8 spec scared people off
- Maybe have a compcafe
    - MB001 (always empty) Tuesday - @Funk Pigeon contact dept
    - Snacks and cw help and stuff
- We’ll help with PhysCafe
- Lightning Talks
    - OC003 - too big for number of people
    - Timing was not the best
    - 2nd batch felt better - but was later than ideal (5pm after CtF)
    - Stay with 2 batches - W3 & 8
- Academic talks - alright but then there was Accenture
- Tech Team has been getting into gear
    - Requires non-exec to be (too?) proactive to be involved
    - Have PC Building workshop to get people more interested early next term
- FNG been much better, but skill issue for LANs
- Some sponsors want insta posts in new year
