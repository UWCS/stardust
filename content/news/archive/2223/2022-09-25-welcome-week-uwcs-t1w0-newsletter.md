<p data-block-key="sfd3i">This is our first issue of the year! Discover our many events over welcome week!</p>

<!-- more -->

Hello everyone, I'm Owen (he/him) your friendly everyday secretary. I'll be writing your newsletters for the next few months, amongst some other bits: exciting, isn't it? 

We have plenty of events in Welcome Week to get you familiar with the society, the course, and hopefully each other. 

The way these newsletters will work is to give you a summary of what we have going on each week, with links to our website for more details.
