<p data-block-key="sfd3i">Election Results, plenty of Free Food, and our Programming Challenge!</p>

<!-- more -->

> Due to the posting times of the newsletter, this is quite old news by now, but [our Elections results are out!](https://uwcs.co.uk/news/agm-election-results/) We have a lovely new set of exec (most importantly, Serene will be taking over writing the newsletters) and some fun(?) motions. 
>
> In some spectacular timing, we are accidentally giving out (or ordering) food every day this week -- I know some people have joked about living of UWCS free pizza, but your dream is becoming a reality!
>
> Our very own programming challenge happens on Wednesday, which I have heard loads about already 👀. There's probably free pizza, but if there isn't, you didn't hear that from me...
>
> On Thursday, we have a double whammy, a belated pancake day event at The Oaks and a bonus gaming event for our Women & NB members!
