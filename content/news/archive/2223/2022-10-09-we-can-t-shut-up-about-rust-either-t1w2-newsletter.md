<p data-block-key="sfd3i">Our Rust course is starting, and we have our first circle!</p>

<!-- more -->

> Welcome to your weekly dose of *I don't know how we manage to organize this much stuff!* Our two highlights for the week are our Rust Course starting and our first circle! Our Rust course will teach you why it is Stack Overflow's most loved language, and circling will teach you why Christmas is our most loved season (just so I don't get murdered -- I will, in fact, say Halloween is actually our favourite). We also have the continuation of our beginner Python Course, and our standard (but no less exciting) Pub Meal and Friday Night Gaming!

***

## **[🍔 Weekly Pub Meal](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/pub-meal-22t1w2/)**
**🕖 Mon 10 Oct 7pm - 9pm  📍 [Varsity](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=8812)**  
Celebrate your first week of teaching with a meal and some chat. This time, we've learnt our lesson and reserved some tables, let's hope it will be enough! This week we'll be completing the full rounds of the campus pubs at Varsity!

***

## **[🌐 xSoc Python Course Session 2](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/xsoc-python-course-2/)**
**🕖 Tue 11 Oct 7pm - 9pm  📍 [OC0.03](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=13224) / [OC0.01](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=13236)**  

Continuing on from week 1, Coding Society will be walking you through the basics of if statements and creating functions and put them into practice. We'll also be starting the Wahoot project!

This course will take you from a complete novice to creating a quiz program, so if you've fancied creating some gadgets, a website, or automating some daily task: this course will bring anyone up to speed! Find materials and catch-up on previous weeks at [go.uwcs.uk/python](https://go.uwcs.uk/python)

**🕖 Wed 12 Oct 7pm - 11:59pm  📍 [Copper Rooms](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=2131)**  
Dig out your Christmas jumpers and join us for our first circle of the year next Wednesday in the Copper Rooms for some mince pies, festive cheer, and plenty of purple! It may be the wrong season, but there's nothing like cracking out our Christmas Tree from storage. We'll then migrate into POP! and experience the true majesty of Disco Dave!

You'll need to get Week 2 Circling Tickets (not event only) [here](tickets.warwicksu.com/ents/event/22901) (they may be sold out already, I haven't checked)

## **[⚙️Rust Course Start](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/rust-course-start/)**
**🕖 Thu 13 Oct 7pm - 9pm  📍 [MS.01](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=6009) / [CS0.06](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1560)**  

*For experienced programmers (at least comfortable in a couple of languages).* Are you ready to learn one of the most loved languages by developers? This week will introduce the course and the language! We'll be giving a primer lecture followed by you getting started on our first project!

With the support of a grant by the Rust Foundation, we'll be guiding you through what makes Rust stand out from the crowd, and get hands-on with some projects. First, Tic-tac-toe. Next, a Chip-8 Interpreter. Finally, a Graphics Raytracer built from the ground up. Not to be missed!
