<p data-block-key="sfd3i">Our regular newsletter person is out of action, we&#x27;re holding a Docker workshop, and LAN has returned. Read all about it!</p>

<!-- more -->

> Well, it's the second week of term and it looks like our regular newsletter writer, Owen, is drowning in coursework and out of action for this week. I'm sure he definitely won't regret handing over to me. We were thinking about running Chat-GPT on this thing so we have an excuse to [reduce our exec count](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6931738441445478400), but it spent the first five paragraphs defining what a newsletter actually was so I think we're safe for now.
> 
> Does anyone even read these opening paragraphs?
> 
> Do your eyes slide right over them?
> 
> Am I speaking into the void?
> 
> Speaking of the void, that's currently where most of our server infrastructure is, as we to get it back online after the migration. The main website (at time of newsletter) is back up thankfully, and other services are being worked on as I type. If you're interested in watching tech team set everything on fire, grab your popcorn and [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/uwcs) if you haven't already.
> 
> WASD 2023, our upcoming speedrunning event, is shaping up to be pretty good. The run schedule has been drafted up, and in the next couple days we'll put out a joint post with Esports [on our Instagram](https://instagram.com/warwickcompsoc) for it!
> 
> I've also been advised to continue pestering you about elections. Okay look, I know they're happening in Week 6, on Friday, at the Oculus, but y'know, it's important everyone knows sooner rather than later. It's pretty funny telling people to [become a society member](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/computing/#org-join) in a newsletter sent out to society members only (we would never do that) - instead, you should find the nearest person and shill the Computing Society to them over and over again until they join. Otherwise, how else are they supposed to vote for you?
> 
> As for events this week, it's a pretty big week on the gaming side! Our LAN runs from Friday 7pm all the way to Sunday 6pm in LIB2, replacing Friday Night Gaming with a whole host of events. Provided people show up, it should be fun. My bias towards academic stuff is showing here, but I'm also looking forward to the Docker workshop. More details below...
***

## **[🍔 1. The Weekly Pub Meal](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/pub-meal-22t2w2/)**
**🕡 Monday 6:30pm - 9pm  📍 The Dirty Duck**  
Do you eat food? Do you require sustenance to stay alive? Would you tolerate doing that in the same place as other society members, with some good food? Well, we're at the Dirty Duck this Monday, so I guess you can do that if you want.
***

## **[☕ 2. CompCafé](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/compcafe-22t2w2/)**
**🕔 Tuesday 5pm - late  📍 [CS0.01](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1557)**  
CompCafé is happening for more than one week, so we'll call that a success! It's every Tuesday, and designed to get people together. We're expecting it to be a bit of a quieter week now that the start-of-term deadlines are out of the way, but it's still a great place to work through some topics, ask for help on things, bounce ideas off people, or generally hang out. We'll have people on hand if you need support with your studies.

I've asked them to buy more snacks this week, so hopefully they won't get consumed in the first 15 minutes again.
***

## **[🐋 3. Docker, Contained](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/docker-talk/)**
**🕐 Wednesday 2pm - 3pm  📍 [CS0.06](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1560)**  
Whale whale whale, what do we have here? A chance to learn how to containerise your applications, that's what. This short talk and longer workshop cover not just the what why and how of Docker, but also continuous integration with GitHub Actions, and deployment.

No more 'well it works on my machine', when you're using some OS-level virtualisation 😎
***

## **[🍸 4. Wildcards (Women + NB) Circle](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/wildcards-circle/)**
**🕐 Wednesday 7pm - 10pm  📍 [H0.56](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=532)**  
The superior circling experience, for our women and non-binary members :)

Theme: "On Wednesdays, we wear pink"

And as always, if you'd like to join the Wildcards group chat, contact our inclusivity officers.

## **[🎮 5 Weekend-Long LAN!](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/lan-party-22-t2/)**
**🕖 Friday 7pm - Sunday 6pm  📍 [LIB2](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=5753)**  
Well it's the last one I have to write, and it's a big one. We're happy to announce that CompSoc LANs are back, and better than ever! It's our continuous, weekend-long gaming event, and jam-packed full of events. Let me list them out in a single sentence:

We've got Friday Night Gaming, Ultimate Fighting Champion Tournament, Late-Night Party Games, Last Civ Standing, Anarchy Chess, Ultra-Hardcore Minecraft, Quiz Night (ft. Pizza), Sigma Movie Night, Geoguessr, Wildcards, Big-Lobby Games, and the CompSocCoin exchange.

If you're wondering what those event names actually mean, the [Instagram post that Brendan and I made](https://www.instagram.com/p/CncTCy2tui1/) does a pretty good job of explaining that.

The more events you take part in and win, the more CompSocCoins you collect. CompSocCoins are a very real currency stored on the decentralised* blockchain** that is very real and good. Invest, and redeem them for prizes at the end of the LAN!
