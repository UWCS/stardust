# 99.7% of UWCS members could open the last email

> Congrats to all but one of you who opened last week's newsletter (if you trust the SU's email tracking). I completely trust these numbers, and have absolutely no doubt that clickbait is the way forward! (Bad luck, we are becoming like your favourite YouTuber) 

> Welcome to another week of me being busy -- turns out there is quite a lot to do in a degree. Speaking of things to do our alumni and SME talks with DCS are on Wednesday, and have a very wide range of speakers! 
>
> WASD 2023, our speedrunning marathon is happening in under two weeks **(11-12th Feb)** in the SU Atrium! It turns out organizing a speedrunning marathon is difficult, and the tech test overrunning might have something to do with this newsletter being late!
>
> The paperwork for a CS Ball might possibly be going through at the moment, so there might possibly be information and tickets available shortly. But um, you didn't hear that for me.
>
> And finally, it's about time for an update on our server ... *situation*. They are back to mostly working! If you want to run something on our servers, create a new account at [accounts.uwcs.co.uk](https://accounts.uwcs.co.uk/), then wait a little, then you have access to our server Hopper through SSH at `uwcs.co.uk`, and Portainer (for running larger programs in containers) at [portainer.uwcs.co.uk](https://portainer.uwcs.co.uk/). If you want some guidance or something more fancy, ask our exec in #tech-team on Discord.
