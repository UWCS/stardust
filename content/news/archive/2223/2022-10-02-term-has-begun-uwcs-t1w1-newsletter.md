# Term has Begun | UWCS T1W1 Newsletter

I hope you all enjoyed welcome week, whether you are actually a fresher or not! I think it was the only time in the past few years that I actually needed an afternoon nap, apart from running [WASD](https://twitter.com/warwickspeedrun). Anyway, teaching is beginning, but somehow, our events haven't slowed down! We have our usual social pub meetup (now back to its regular spot) and friday gaming. 

Our academic events are no slouch too: follow our Git Good Talk with a Workshop to put it into practice or start our Python course. This course is for complete beginners only -- but if you are fairly experienced, our Rust course is starting next week!

## **[🍔 Weekly Pub Meal](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/week1-pub-meal/)**
**🕖 Mon  3 Oct 7pm - 9pm  📍 [Dirty Duck](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=2202)**  
After the first full day of teaching, how about a meal? Last time, we gave the Phantom Coach staff quite a scare after 40 people descended on them in the late afternoon. So for this week, we're staying on-campus, and going to The Dirty Duck. See you there!

## **[🌐 xSoc Python Course START](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/xsoc-python-course-start/)**

*Aimed at complete beginners to computer science!* Week 1 is kicking off with a talk from us outlining the course and some basic Python concepts, followed by a workshop session to put them in practice. We'll be collaborating on these sessions with Warwick AI and Coding Society.

**🕒 Wed  5 Oct 3pm - 5pm  📍 [CS0.01](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/?cmsid=1557)**  
Following on from our rapid-pace [Git Good talk](https://uwcs.co.uk/resources/git-good/), we will be giving you hands-on experience with Git. You'll get practice on everything in the talk, which really helps understand everything. We'll also have some experienced exec members on hand to answer any of the many questions that arise from your first(?) journey into version control.

Join us Friday for a night of fun! With a ton of games and consoles, plus our VR setup. Last week was quite crazy! Loads of you came along, so much so our pizza order cost £250. There will be our regular pizza order, but our bank account cannot keep it free!
