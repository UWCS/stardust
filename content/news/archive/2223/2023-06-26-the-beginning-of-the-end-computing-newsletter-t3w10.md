> But seriously, I hope you all have (and will) enjoyed being Serene's captive audience at least as much as you (definitely) enjoyed being mine. UWCS was an amazing part of my year, and it's very sad to be moving on. But you haven't quite got rid of me yet: I'll be helping with [WASD](https://warwickspeed.run/) next February, so see some of you there! (no I will not miss an opportunity to shill WASD)
