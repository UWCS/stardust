<p data-block-key="sfd3i">This week: the 2nd half of our spooky celebrations, a Game Jam - but in Scratch, Fresher Rep Elections, an industry talk from QRT, and our courses continuing!</p>

<!-- more -->

> Forget what we said about relaxed schedules last week, with an event every day from Monday to Saturday! We start with our trip to Kasbah to get a spooky clubbing fix, our new sponsor Qube will give us an insight into their industry, and our Scratch Game Jam with Game Design will be great fun (and technically, academic)!
>
> Our courses are nearing completion and still going strong, with the cross-society Python course in its penultimate week and our Rust course finishing! 1st years will have a chance to run and vote in the elections for our Fresher Rep!
