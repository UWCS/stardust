Head over to *Calcium Cafe*, a mix of Milk Monday and CompCafé in one! We also have **three** different talks occurring this week, so consider attending one *(they are all super interesting)*. The last day to purchase UWCS merchandise is Monday, May 8 at 12 pm, so consider purchasing the merch before its all out!

>Please do take some opportunity to relax this week if possible! :)
