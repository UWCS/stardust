<p>We&#x27;re nearing the end of the term, but newsletters never change! It&#x27;s the week 9 newsletter!</p>

<!-- more -->

Good morning\! Yes, it's morning because I say it is, even though I'm sending out this newsletter at whatever time I send it out. Anyway... here's this week's newsletter\!

### **Extraordinary General Meeting**

#### *Monday 28th June, 6pm*

We will be holding an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on **Monday 28th June** at **6PM** to elect a new president for UWCS. The president is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the society, represents the society in an official capacity, and manages the exec committee among other responsibilities. While you can nominate yourself on the day, we welcome nominations ahead of time. You will also have the opportunity to give a short speech on the day. Please contact Anna, our returning officer, via <returning-officer@uwcs.co.uk> if you wish to nominate yourself for this role.

We will also be presenting a constitution-changing motion at the EGM: **Motion to Require the Appointment of a Standing President in the Event of Extended Absence of Resignation of the President**. You can view the motion here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sFINrjXKkp6ntxxgNkNxbCQ-murXj8NtxSbVrWDoHXk/edit?usp=sharing>

Voting will follow the STV process and be held on the same voting portal used in the AGM Elections earlier this year. The voting period will last 2 days and will open shortly after the EGM finishes. Results will be announced on Thursday 1st July.

If you were an official member of the society as of Monday 14th June, you will be eligible to vote in this election and on the motion, as well as being eligible to stand for President. Anyone who became a member after this date is not eligible to vote in this election. Please contact Anna, our returning officer, via <returning-officer@uwcs.co.uk> if you are not sure if you are included in this.

A test vote has been set up on our Voting Portal with all eligible votes added. If you are intending to vote in the upcoming EGM, please do double check that you see and can vote in the test election presented there. You can access the voting portal by heading to <https://vote.uwcs.co.uk> and signing in with your UWCS website account. If you can't see a vote, or if you have any other issue, please email Anna via <returning-officer@uwcs.co.uk> as soon as possible so we can ensure this election goes as smoothly as possible.

The EGM will be held on Teams and we will provide a link to join this nearer the time. We will also cross-stream the EGM to our Discord server.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in \#exec in our [Discord server](https://discord.uwcs.uk), or message one of the exec directly if you'd rather ask in private.

### **Summer LAN**

#### *aka CompSoc plays games and does stuff, aka post exam extravaganza*

It's that time of the year again, it's Summer LAN time\! Join us Monday to Friday of Week 10, **28th June to 2nd July** for a fun-filled week of games, chilling out and just generally doing things.

For those unfamiliar, LAN stands for Local Area Network. In a normal world, we‚Äôd normally gather in a large room in the Library, bring our computers and have a fun time chatting, getting to know others, and generally some video games too. Alas, this year, we will be doing the same virtually, with our Discord server replacing the room in the library. The sort of things you can expect to see at LAN include:

  - A range of tournaments - feeling competitive? Well, you've come to the right place\!
  - A quiz - get ready to test your knowledge of everything\!
  - A movie night - who knows what movie or how it will go, but hey, it's a movie\!
  - Our music server Amphi - add your favourite tunes to the server and listen with everyone else at the same time
  - Just general playing games and chatting\!

A full schedule of the events we will be running this week can be found below:

We'll be running Summer LAN in our Discord server, which you can join here: <https://discord.uwcs.uk/> You'll need to download any games you want to play ahead of time, but we will announce what is running each day to give you some notice\!

Closer to the time, we'll be moving some channels around in an attempt to recreate the authentic LAN experience a bit.

While LAN is running from Monday to Friday, there's no obligation to stay for the whole time. Feel free to just pop in for a bit of time here and there\! Don't fancy taking part in any of the events? No problem at all\! We'll still be around to chat and chill or play other games too.

We look forward to seeing you there\!
