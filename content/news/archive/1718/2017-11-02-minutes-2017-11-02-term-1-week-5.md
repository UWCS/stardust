#### Sponsorship Money

- We have money from one sponsor but not both yet.

- The SU system is bad.

#### Charity Event

- Warwick Kickstart have approached us wanting to run a charity gaming event.

- Would be nice generally to host more charity events.

- Will discuss further with them in due course, want to nominate our own charity (EFF, Extra Life).

- Looking like end of week 9, or roughly then.

  

#### Talks

- Not amazing turnout for BBC talk, but to be expected due to time of day.

- Another talk later on in the term about compilers.

  

#### Exec

- Equal Ops can be given to Ed if he'd like it (not present) - he fills a similar role already.

- Gaming Officer - this is more difficult to find, most people who stay all the time are already exec. We asked Amelie, who said yes.

  - LANa del Rey

  - Weird Al LANkovic
