Hi there. I thought I'd take this opportunity to tell you about a great opportunity for all students.



***

#### What is it?
Next April (2022), the British Computer Society are organising an online event, which provides an amazing opportunity for women and non-binary students.

Included with this colloquium is a poster competition, which can be based on anything at all. Previously, submissions have been on topics such as quantum computing and medical image processing. The sky is your limit\!

#### **Competition Steps**

1.  Write a **250 word abstract** on the topic of your poster. This will be due **Friday 4th February 2022**.  
    [Here are some examples from previous years.](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/?page_id=94)  
    [Here is a link to submit your abstract.](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=9oiGHHRq7Umec4Yl2FW9HPWjMkG1RadHk_QbEPx1KJZUQVY4VURMVkcxTjNGNFg2S005V0FXTElJVy4u)
2.  Successful abstracts will be announced **Friday 4th March 2022**.
3.  If your abstract is accepted, you will have to submit a **PDF poster and short video** by **Friday 25th March 2022**. The best 100 or so abstracts will be accepted, so if you make it to this stage, congrats\! This video should be about 2 minutes and will help judges assess all submissions in advance of the event. It is recommended you write your abstract using a text editor and then paste it into the form.
4.  Event time\! This will be held on **Wednesday 13th April 2022**, and will be hosted by Aberystwyth University, Lancaster University and London South Bank University. Again, the event is online, and you will have the chance to network and enjoy various talks.

#### Notes
This contest is available to all women and non-binary students of computing and related subjects. This is interpreted very broadly; for example, in the past, students on computer arts, cognitive science, information systems and more courses. If you aren't sure if your subject will be accepted, feel free to email <bcswomenlovelace@gmail.com> and they will most likely say yes\!

That's all for now. Congrats if you've read this far\!
