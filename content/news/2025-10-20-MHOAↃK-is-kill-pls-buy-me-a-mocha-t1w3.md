We find ourselves living within an oblate sphere, and sometimes that leads us to strange places, to do strange things, to experience strange events and timelines. And well, this strange timeline finds me writing another strange newsletter, following a 54 hour awake time from an SU saga, to FNG, to once again attempting to sort our cupboards, to doing the night shift again at WHACK.

After much wearing of a hard hat, eating a lot of food, rickrolling thrice at 4:30am, and realising picking the train track with an infinite number of people on it in the demented version of the trolley problem creates 1/12th of a life, and far more, I can confirm I have now slept, hallelujah!

Thank you to everyone that attended WHACK, we hope you enjoyed it and we hope to see you at more events in the future :)

There's usually one of us at the vast majority of events, and especially for ensuring welfare presence at drinking events - often we'll be identifiable by our exec hoodies!

#### 🕖 Fri 24th Oct 7pm - LATE  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *One more till Halloween FNG, and then LAN, and then LAN*
The Friday night fun continues in unquestionably the best way to round off the week ~~Raven is definitely not biased in writing this~~, along with free snacks and drinks.

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.
**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`) and Sharvil (`w.0lf`) - come find us at any point if you need help, or even just to yap. We'll often be identifiable by our exec hoodies :)

We have a huge selection of fun activities for you to choose from, so come along for a great night :)

There are tons of options for consoles: Xbox with Rockband, Wii, Nintendo Switches (including a Switch 2!), PS4 and more—all having a huge variety of games.

If you are more into Steam, we have that too, just ask us for our DCS account login! Not only that, but you can get full access to the department computers and enjoy a wide selection of free games (wow!)

It doesn't stop there folks. We also have a ~~freaking~~ Oculus VR headset, so you can immerse yourself in Metaverse games. Beat Saber is a popular choice, but we have tons of options!

Did you think that was it? We even have Jackbox along with other party games that will continue through the night.

Hope to see you there :3
