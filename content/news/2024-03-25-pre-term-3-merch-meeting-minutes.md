# Notes
## Agenda I: How  
- Most items are 20 - 40 orders 
- May or may not be able to subsidise, need to check SU finance & student activities (email) 
	- Serene will email student activities
	- If we can subsidise, talk to treasurer and see how much can be subsidised (subsidising will increase number of orders)
	- If not, then the merch will be more expensive
	- Can overestimate the number of orders, sell orders at cheaper price, then pay the difference 
- Subsidising exec merch is allowed 
- Tech will work out how merch.uwcs.co.uk functions

		- Exec icons (from discord) on hoodies 
		- Samit will look at redesigning the exec hoodies
	- Maybe do a quarter zip  
- Previous changes 
	- Added hoodies
	- Changed the blue on everything
## Agenda III: When
- Last year, sales opened (1st May) and were closed a little into term (8th May)
	- things took around a month to arrive 
	- If we can open earlier that would be ideal, however will be likely to be the same dates 
- Owen recommends opening over Easter and closing the first week of term
	- Unlikely to happen if we redesign 
## Agenda IV: Other 
- Move milk Mondays to milk midnight at LAN 
- Colour code the keys for the cabinets (will bring washi tape)
