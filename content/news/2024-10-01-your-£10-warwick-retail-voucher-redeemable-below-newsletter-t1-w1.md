HELLO fake, faker and fakest mathematicians (and the few real ones of you here). This newsletter isn't late, I am simply immune to your mere mortal ways of measuring time.

It is with great pleasure that I get to welcome you and all your fresh faces to the University of Warwick (except the old ones, welcome back I guess), and to the world of despair (a computer science degree). You've just entered a new world of fun, and despite the relentless ~~pain and suffering~~ lectures you'll be enduring for the next 10 weeks, UWCS have your back! We're starting off the term with some absolutely BANGER events so you can make *even more friends* and enjoy yourself!

Since we have a lot of new faces I just want to remind you that the society has a couple of welfare officers, so whether you're feeling homesick, worried, lonely or otherwise struggling, we have the fabulous Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034) who can be contacted on discord or found at many of our socials!

To start off the first day of the year we will be going to the ~~Dirty Duck~~ **Phantom Coach**! (Apparently the Duck has no gas and can't cook? Seems like a pretty bad idea guys). We would be honoured to help you relax over food, or not, you don’t have to eat, with our trip to the *Phoach*; I’m sure those Monday lectures are gonna be quite harsh after months of freedom and fun!

We had an incredible turnout to our Welcome Week FNG, and so I'm sure you can't wait for Friday to roll around for the next one. Get up, come to DCS, and play games with all the friends you've made through our amazing events. Nothing could ever make you happier, or provide a better break from your degree ~~this has not been fact checked, and I do not have a source~~

So there it is! This wraps up all the events for the first week of the year and it is PACKED. I know you've heard it a thousand times already, bt congratulations to all the first years for making it here, and remember the welfare officers exist if yo're having a hard time - Ray and their super secret ghost writer <3
