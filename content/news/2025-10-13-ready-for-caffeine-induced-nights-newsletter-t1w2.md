Heyyy everyone, I'm Crystal -- your actual Secretary that is not an imaginary Secretary. I'm a 2nd year CS student and love to yap to others so hmu if you ever see me. You'll most probably spot me in all of the wildcard events otherwise the inclusivity officer would strangle me.

Anyways, GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE STILL READING OUR NEWSLETTERS. To every member who just joined our society, welcomeee!! Also, you will receive newsletters every week, outlining our main events that you should definitely show up to because we're great people. 

I hope everyone had a great first week, hopefully not falling behind academics already. For the first years, may the robot not drive you insane like how it did to me.

If you haven't already, it's a good idea to join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uPVfUMeJX4) and follow our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/warwickcompsoc/) to keep up-to-date with all we're organising (including a lot of going outside!), talk to fellow students, get academic help, and much more!

# Welfare Notice

UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Thomas (Discord: tomo.li) - good chance you've seen us around already with the exec hoodies on, but especially since we have a lot of new people, we want to make ourselves known. You can speak to us in-person, or message us over Discord, and we can help give you advice and signpost when you're going through stuff, whether that's trying to navigate the various support systems within the uni, or something has happened involving a member of the society e.g. at an event, and more. Starting uni can especially be quite overwhelming, just know we're here to help, and it's okay to not be okay!

After our great success with powerpoint & chill and cat's cafe, we are having sus & chill now!! Yes, Irene is very suspicious for choosing such a topic. Anyways, let me quote Irene:

We’re gonna play some very suspicious games 🤨 including Among Us, Werewolf and Mafia!
Do you have zero experience in these?? (how did you escape amogus??) Not to worry, we’ll explain everything!
Just be ready to not trust anyone for two hours.

Also, free drinks of course. The DCS vending machine will always be free for us wildcards during the event because DCS loves us.

This term, UWCS is bringing you THREE CIRCLES alongside a line-up of epic socials - more details coming soon... trust me. 

**THEME: BIG MEAL**
#### What does "Big Meal" mean...?
Great question. The true meaning has been lost to time... but that just means you guys get to take the risk of figuring it out!

Come dressed as anything you'd find in, on, or around a BIG MEAL - whether that's a 🍔 burger, a 🌭 hotdog, a 🍽️ dining table, or even a 🧂 salt shaker. The wilder, the better! Tbh if it's as low effort as printing out a picture and sticking it on that'll do I really don't care 🫡

We'll be heading to POP after Kelsey's, so grab your tickets now:

#### *They say the sky's the limit but here the ceiling is the limit*
The Friday night fun continues in unquestionably the best way to round off the week, along with free snacks and drinks.

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`) and Sharvil (`w.0lf`) - come find us at any point if you need help, or even just to yap. We'll often be identifiable by our exec hoodies :)

We have a huge selection of fun activities for you to choose from, so come along for a great night :)

There are tons of options for consoles: Xbox with Rockband, Wii, Nintendo Switches (including a Switch 2!), PS4 and more—all having a huge variety of games.

If you are more into Steam, we have that too, just ask us for our DCS account login! Not only that, but you can get full access to the department computers and enjoy a wide selection of free games (wow!)

It doesn't stop there folks. We also have a ~~freaking~~ Oculus VR headset, so you can immerse yourself in Metaverse games. Beat Saber is a popular choice, but we have tons of options!

Did you think that was it? We even have Jackbox along with other party games that will continue through the night.

Hope to see you there :3

#### 🕘 Sat 18th Oct 9am - 5pm  📍 [Oculus](https://link.mazemap.com/arGGKMmB)
#### *A perfectly reasonable excuse to go insane for the weekend*
Our successful hackathon last year returns for an even bigger run in the Oculus - if you managed to grab a ticket before they sold out, we hope to see you there!

There'll be free food and drinks during the event so you won't starve to death. There'll be sponsor talks for networking. Last but not least, there'll be ✨vibes✨ of sleep deprived students grinding their eyes out to build the best possible, not seen by humanity's picasso level project 💥 :OO Anyways see you there. Bring snacks, coffee and monster if you wanna survive based on my own experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's a very packed week ahead. I'm especially looking forward to the hackathon because my friends and I stayed up for 37 hours straight HAHAHA (I'm scared help like actually give me caffeine durinng the hackathon and I will love you for life). Anyways, good luck with the 2nd week of term guys!!
