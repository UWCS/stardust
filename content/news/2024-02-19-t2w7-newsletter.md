Welp, we are week 7 in the term. Assignments are due. Reading week has just ended. It is becoming slightly too warm outside. Stress is building. Time to counteract all of this by enjoying some snacks and drinks from Comp Cafe and working away in the labs!

There will always be free vend from the coffee machine in the common room for anyone wanting that as well :)
