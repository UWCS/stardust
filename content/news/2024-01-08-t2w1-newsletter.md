i am sorry we are now back~~

<!-- more -->

Happy New Year to everyone! We hope you had a restful winter break and have fully recovered from the term one pain.

**Since term has started,** it is worth reminding you that our weekly events are still going on! There is no coursework yet, so there is time to come, hang out, and relax!

This week is light, so you can choose from: *Pub Meal*, *Comp Cafe*, or *Friday Night Gaming* for some free drinks and snacks, or just a fun time.

I feel like I have to write more since I usually fill this with a ton of information, but honestly it is such a chill week. Please do rest and enjoy it before modules get more stressful :)

Comp Cafe typically is for working on coursework, espeically if you want some help from other years. There isn't much coursework going on right now, but doesn't mean you can't stop by and just hang out (and take some free snacks)!

There will always be free vend from the coffee machine in the common room for anyone wanting that as well :)

It is our first Friday Night Gaming for the term, so there *might* be some special activities planned, but you'll have to pass by to find out 

We have tons of consoles and games you can play around with if you want (or need) a break! Steam, Jackbox, Wii, Rockband and more!

Stop by and enjoy our weekly FNG with us! (*also, we will be providing free snacks so just take some*)
