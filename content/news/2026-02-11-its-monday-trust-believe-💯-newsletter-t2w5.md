Look look. It may be Wednesday. Why is the newsletter coming out today? I have no idea, I'm not an exec, and I was suddenly granted this power so I'll try my best 😭. Help (please... game jam killed me this week).

ANYWAYS There's some huge events this week, the end of the Game Jam today, so come along to the showcase at 2-4! (Me + Irene's game's codebase is held together with hopes and dreams 💯)

WASD 10th Anniversary is happening! As an ex-speedrunner (I have one entry on speedrun.com so it counts), I do NOT have the skills that these guys have. How do they do it? I don't know 😭.

Now we are keeping the announcements for pub meal and laser tag.. even though they have already happened, soooo pretend they are still happening definitely for sure 🙂‍↕️.

# Welfare Notice
UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Tom (Discord tomo.li). We can also be reached via our email inbox at welfare@uwcs.co.uk.

You can speak to us at any time via Discord, email, and in-person (often in our exec hoodies), for advice, signposting and support. This can be for navigating the uni's support services, or to disclose something not right that happened due to someone's conduct at one of our events, and much more.

Any discussions you have will stay with the specific Welfare Officer, unless you permit otherwise.

# [👾 Friday Night Gaming (7pm till LateTM) 👾](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/2/5/friday-night-gaming-(7pm-till-latetm)/)
#### 🕖 Fri 13th Feb 7pm - 5am  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *Games. Games. And unlimited Bacon (not really).*
Friday Nights. Gaming. FNG. That's all we've known. PCs, consoles, VR, snacks and drinks. The pinnacle. The untoppable *and* unstoppable force. Sometimes you must choose between the last U1 and continuing Never Gonna Give You Up on Clone Hero. Your home for some beats? Aye, a worthy sacrifice.

Join us in DCS every Friday from 7pm, until you see Raven conked out on the floor from exhaustion sometime on Saturday.

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`), Sharvil (`w.0lf`), Laina (`vomitspawn`), and Santiago (`colombian.`) - if you need help or just wanna yap, come find us :)


We have our DCS account login - any game (including via Steam!) that you can get running, you can play. We also have several consoles, including Xboxes, PS4, Switch 1 & 2, Wii, along with our PCs which I call Nuke Machine and Microwave, which you can use our Valve Index on, play Clone Hero, and more! We also have board games for anybody wanting a less tech-based way to enjoy games :)

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

Hope to see you there :3 (Note: you don't have to be a DCS student to come along!)

That's all for now, halfway point of the term, so it's only gonna get worse from here 🥲. I am now going to grind formal languages until I can understand at least half of the next lecture. Good luck with coursework, everyone!!

I don't know how to end newsletters, soo I'll leave you guys with some wise words of wisdom:
"Functional programming this, functional programming that, sometimes (all times) it's okay to be a dysfunctional programmer."

-Mikey (imposter exec, no.1 dysfunctional programmer, going to sleep for 24 hours now)


**Disclaimer:**
Crystal, the actual secretary, totally did not forcefully conscript him. However, for code quality purposes, pair ~~email~~ programming was practised in this email development. If you see Mikey around, show him some love for writing this epic newsletter.
