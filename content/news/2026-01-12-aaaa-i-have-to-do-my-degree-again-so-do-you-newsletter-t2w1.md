Impostor Secretary, Impostor On A Year-Outer (back today though!), yes it's a wild Raven bringing you the opening newsletter for this term. Hope y'all had a restful break, and we hope to see y'all throughout Term 2 :3

~~does the title mean I'm crowdsourcing people to people to do my degree? oops~~

Anyway, we have a few bits to round-up before we get into this week's events!

## Information Sources
- [Our Events Website](https://events.uwcs.co.uk) - Centralised events information, as well as an importable `iCal` so you can sync our events to your phone calendar

## Welfare Notice
UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: `raven0034`) and Tom (Discord `tomo.li`). We can also be reached via our email inbox at [welfare@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:welfare@uwcs.co.uk).

You can speak to us at any time via Discord, email, and in-person (often in our exec hoodies), for advice, signposting and support. This can be for navigating the uni's support services, or to disclose something not right that happened due to someone's conduct at one of our events, and much more.

*Any discussions you have will stay with the specific Welfare Officer, unless you permit otherwise.*

We hope you enjoy Term 2 - but it's okay if it doesn't quite go to plan, we're here to help!

- We've also published our Winter Meeting Minutes, which you can find on our website at: [https://uwcs.co.uk/categories/meeting-minutes/](https://uwcs.co.uk/categories/meeting-minutes/)

- We circulated a feedback form just after the end of Term 1 - to complete the feedback loop, and to be transparent to members, we went round the various exec roles to collect responses where applicable, so you can see what we're doing well and what we're looking to improve on going forwards
  - We collected responses from various wonderful exec on Event Communication, EGM/Elections, Welfare, Gender Inclusivity, Socials, Gaming, Academic, Sports & even Tech!
  - This is available at: [https://uwcs.co.uk/news/2026-01-12-term-1-feedback-responses/](https://uwcs.co.uk/news/2026-01-12-term-1-feedback-responses/)

  - We appreciate every member's voice, and all feedback is useful, and we hope to hear more from y'all - making sure y'all're heard helps keeps us accountable, and to create a better society year-on-year :3

## [🗣️ Wildcards & Chill (PowerPoint) 🗣️](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/2/1/wildcards-&-chill-(powerpoint)/)
#### 🕒 Wed 14th Jan 3pm - 5pm  📍 [CS0.07](https://link.mazemap.com/LlSHtRHH)
#### *A@W infodumping, but Wildcards /lh*
To start off our weekly Wildcards event we want to get to know all of the Wildcards a lot better - how you may ask?
Why, ridiculous and insane PowerPoints of course!

Do you have an interest you NEED people to know about? Perhaps why your favourite movie/game/musical is the BEST THING EVER CREATED™️? Or maybe you have some random informative presentation from 5 years ago?

Please bring your most unhinged presentations and come along!

(and if you need some ideas, DM Irene (eneri0564), she'll give you three interesting topics just for you)

The presentations don’t have to be long at all, and you can just come and watch if you want!
(If there’s not enough presentations we’ll switch to board games so)

But most importantly - FREE SNACK AND DRINKS‼️‼️
these will be provided from Co-op courtesy of DCS 🙏

## [♟️ Chess Engine Workshop ♟️](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/2/1/chess-engine-workshop/)
#### 🕔 Fri 16th Jan 5pm - 6pm  📍 [CS1.04](https://link.mazemap.com/W4LPll6U)
#### *Have you tried the Tennison Gambit Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Variation? Or perhaps the Albin Countergambit Nuclear Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Variation*
Can you out-program Stockfish? Or at the very least your peers?

We’re hosting a 3 week long competition to see who can make the best chess bot. We’ve written all the backend, all you need to worry about is the evaluation function (the brain behind the moves).

Open to all levels (if you know basic Python, you can compete)!

INFO WORKSHOP: Friday 16th Jan | 5PM CS1.04

There is £400 in prizes thanks to Optiver, the sponsor of the event. A handful of the best bots will play against human players at a Chess Society club night in Week 5!

#### *Whether it's running for your hopes and dreams, or just out of sheer fear of your degree, we got the training programmes to build leg muscle & resilience*
Weekly runs, open to all members and friends of UWCS. An average week might look like a 5k around campus on a pre-planned route, but as this is the first term for which the event is being run, expect to see a variety of ideas each week.
FOR ALL ABILITY LEVELS.
[Strava - UWCS Run Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1426021)

## [👾 Friday Night Gaming (7pm till LateTM 👾)](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/2/1/friday-night-gaming-(7pm-till-latetm)/)
#### 🕖 Fri 16th Jan 7pm - Sat 17th Jan 5am  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *The most normal event UWCS ever hosts, definitely. Chair catepillar. Banana as a drink stirrer.*
Friday Nights. Gaming. FNG. That's all we've known. PCs, consoles, VR, snacks and drinks. The pinnacle. The untoppable *and* unstoppable force. Sometimes you must choose between the last U1 and continuing Never Gonna Give You Up on Clone Hero. Your home for some beats? Aye, a worthy sacrifice.

Join us in DCS every Friday from 7pm, until you see Raven conked out on the floor from exhaustion sometime on Saturday.

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`), Sharvil (`w.0lf`), Laina (`vomitspawn`), and Santiago (`colombian.`) - if you need help or just wanna yap, come find us :)

We have our DCS account login - any game (including via Steam!) that you can get running, you can play. We also have several consoles, including Xboxes, PS4, Switch 1 & 2, Wii, along with our PCs which I call Nuke Machine and Microwave, which you can use our Valve Index on, play Clone Hero, and more! We also have board games for anybody wanting a less tech-based way to enjoy games :)

WE ALSO HAVE A STEERING WHEEL, PEDALS, GEAR SHIFTER, AND F1 25, DEBUTING THIS WEEK AT FNG!

Want to see new games made available at our events? Fill out [our new form](https://forms.gle/rgX9tF3HAj7RSSSM7) to let us know!

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.
**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

Hope to see you there :3 (Note: you don't have to be a DCS student to come along!)

## [🎾 UWCS x CodeSoc Tennis 🎾](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/2/1/uwcs-x-codesoc-tennis/)
#### 🕛 Sat 17th Jan 12pm - 2pm  📍 [University of Warwick Tennis Centre](https://link.mazemap.com/ctJPT6NK)
#### *Ever wanted to whack someone else's balls around?*
Yes, yet again we are making Computer Science students touch grass and be active (scary I know). But fret not, tennis is one of the greatest sports of all time and very fun to play! This cross society tennis social is a chance for anyone of any ability to come and play some tennis with your course mates and anyone else who wants to join. AND its free to attend obviously. We will provide rackets for anyone who does not have them (but please bring your own if you have one) and tennis balls will be provided. Want to come? Fill out our interest form available [here](https://forms.office.com/e/vjFbBNgT1q).

If I'm gonna be an academic weapon this term, I'll be a fort built from tac-proof Renault Twingos, purpose built with hypersonic weapon interception capabilities, nuclear deterrents, powered by a Rolls-Royce Trent 977B-84 axial-flow high-bypass turbofan engine, producing 372 kilonewtons of take-off thrust fitted by the guy with a hammer in the front bonnet, consuming as little as 11400 gallons of fuel per hour, as well as each coming with a 55R6M S-500 Triumfator-M anti-ballistic missile system (range of 600+ km and sub-4 seconds response time). ~~In other words, this term will be hell on earth. Oh well...~~
