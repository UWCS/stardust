*Editor's note: Once again I am getting absolutely destroyed by exams, so this week we have another guest edition (this time from a math's student with a superiority complex!). I apologise in advance*

HELLOOO (fake, faker, and fakest) mathematicians, it is with great displeasure that I will be writing this weeks newsletter; so buckle up, get showered, put on deodorant, and enjoy.

I’m sure you’re already bored of the newsletters from Ray and Lucy and Ray again but if not you should come and see some familiar faces at this week’s event with a little treat.. ~~BONUS EVENT: A special Ray meet and greet WITH autograph signing. (No pictures allowed.)~~ *Editor's note: I did not sign up for this*

**Additionally**, some merch has now arrived! Lanyards, socks, mugs and stickers and available to pick up at compcafe and FNG this week (just find a member of the exec and ask them to grab it for you)!

And with that all said, I will use my own welfare training to signpost you in the right direction: your marvellous and gorgeous welfare officers! So, if you’re struggling, please get in contact with one of our ~~society happy officers~~ welfare officers on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) or Raven (@raven0034)!
