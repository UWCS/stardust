UWCS has conquered the universe ~~okay not quite~~, I actually made it out of bed, and somehow I've landed on Earth once more to bring you humans yet another transmission. However, good news! No it's not the Dacia Sandero, it's the Citroën Ami Buggy Concept - the original looked lame but imo [this](https://www.citroen.co.uk/about-citroen/concept-cars/new-ami-buggy-concept.html) kinda goes hard as fuck.

So, the dust has settled, some exams were completed, the tornado of FNG goers wiped out our stock of Costco snacks, and somehow we nearly ended up with a catastrophic Amphi bill on our first official FNG 😭 Fear not for now we have Ramphi, which people have been using to make sure I leave Term 3 with no braincells by queuing the weirdest shit ever (WHY JACKIE'S BOX I HATE IT HERE)... (jk ily'all)

# Welfare Notice

As always, we have our wonderful Welfare Officers (hey, it wasn't me that originally said this) here to help you if you encounter any issues: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034) ~~avoid eating too many bananas at FNG though since potassium poisioning is a tricky one to deal with~~. We're here for signposting and advice, and especially as we approach exam season, it's important you look after your wellbeing!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Request from DCS

DCS is working to enhance the quality of assessments and feedback and they'd greatly value your input, which you can provide via their survey [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=vc-6Ce9HZUSSZTVG8ur2vLwzMZbk-3RNpfHPh4L-TN5UMk9EREZFTU9KVFAwWjdBTENEVUQ3NkI2Sy4u).

This will help improve the design and clarity of assessment materials and the feedback provided, making sure courseworks relevant to a module are set, and their grading requirements made clear. Please fill it out, it will only take a few minutes!

# REMINDER FOR THORPE PARK TICKETS

We need to sell 4 more tickets, and they're going quickly! Grab your tickets [here](https://www.warwicksu.com/venues-events/events/4133/26986/) by **22nd May** so you can enjoy the experience (plus figure out if Rowan's actually serious about the Thorpe Park mystery beverage), and so we can break even!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Merch

Crazy news! Merch is making a return soon after this newsletter goes out, and will be open until **9pm Friday**. Unfortunately we can't pay you for being a walking advertisement for the society, *however* I can guarantee you gain extreme levels of respect decked out in our merch, and even more so if you put the goose sticker on your laptop. Keep an eye out on our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk) and our [merch section](https://uwcs.co.uk/merch) for more information!

# [🍔 Pub Meal 🍔](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/pub-coach/)

#### 🕖 Monday 19th May 7pm - 9pm  📍[Phantom Coach](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xNJPdqHAV1bnoFjGA)
#### *no, it is inhumane to capture the goslings and have them for dinner, smh this even needs saying*

After failing to divert from The Dirty Duck last week to take advantage of the 40% discount at Phoach, we are actually going there this week, unfortunately only for a 25% discount :(

Order a mega-mixed grill, chug a cheeky drink, show us your favourite geese, and hey, who knows, maybe you'll find yourself writing another RAAAAH battleship transmission ~~newsletter~~ there. Join us in the right-hand sideroom from 7pm! If you want an extra challenge, maybe discuss which two activities you'd like to see merged and shown in the Olympics - football and spontaneous combustion could be an example (of the balls, not the players, that wouldn't go well).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [ 🏃 UWCS Run Club 🏃 ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/uwcs-run-club/)

#### 🕔 Friday 23rd May 5pm - 6:30pm 📍[Outside DCS](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8858421e6f5928c0c78f?projectId=warwick)
#### *touching grass, voluntarily, and not just because you have no other way to escape the goose army*

UWCS Run Club once again returns, having done weekly 5K runs throughout this term hosted by the Sports Officers. Open to those of any ability, we must endure and build **STAMINA** to power through these last sets of exams, as well as competing for maximum fitness - gotta get peak spoils from the FNG snack table when the vultures inevitably descend at 7pm!

Meet Zach and Alfie outside DCS at 5pm to discover grass, trees and how many backflips in a row you can pull off ~~okay i made that last one up~~!

UWCS has a Strava that you should join [here](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1426021)!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# [ 🎮 Friday Night Gaming 🎮 ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/fng/)

#### 🕖 Friday 23rd May 7pm - 1am 📍[CS Department](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8858421e6f5928c0c78f)
#### *no, not Fortified Nutritional Goslings, I keep telling you we must protect them at all costs! ~~the fluffy things, not Ryan Gosling~~*

Perhaps the tagline seems a bit hypocritical given I keep talking about eating spiders, but hey I'm sure we've all accidentally inhaled a spider or two, it's much more difficult to accidentally inhale a gosling (not that I have experience in this, to clarify).

Anyway, come to FNG, if you have reflexes faster than a cracked FPS player, you can profit from our first round of snacks (more will come out later!). Thankfully, nobody has shown up as a fire-breathing dragon since I last wrote a newsletter, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to stop Community Safety raiding us (they just wanna play Mario Kart too yano!).

Out will be the usual selection of consoles, outrageous Mario Kart wins, battle fighting and much more can happen again!

FNG is ending at **1am** to accommodate exams. Us Gaming Coordinators probably know better than most that gamers are prone to extremely bad sleep schedules (and that's on top of the many CS/uni students' standard shitty sleep schedules!) ~~and tbf since I last wrote this sentence I've been busy researching random stuff at daft o'clock in the morning~~. Apologies for any inconvenience caused!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now the battleship must return to roaming the universe, the cult army is exploring TOI-733 b next!

<< END TRANSMISSION >>

*Anyway*, I've shitposted enough - good luck with any remaining exams, buy some merch, and we hope to see you at our events!
