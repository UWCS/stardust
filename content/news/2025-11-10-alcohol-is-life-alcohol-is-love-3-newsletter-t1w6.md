I don't mean that. I'm not an alcoholic. Guys come for the week 6 circle. Irene and I will be the sober execs, so we are hoping for *quality* entertainment while being sober. Trust me. It is absolute cinema to watch drunk people play drunk games.

# Welfare Notice

UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Thomas (Discord: tomo.li) - good chance you've seen us around already with the exec hoodies on, but especially since we have a lot of new people, we want to make ourselves known. You can speak to us in-person, or message us over Discord, and we can help give you advice and signpost when you're going through stuff, whether that's trying to navigate the various support systems within the uni, or something has happened involving a member of the society e.g. at an event, and more. Starting uni can especially be quite overwhelming, just know we're here to help, and it's okay to not be okay!

#### *I love ~~bowling~~ balls*
🔥 How it works:
When you arrive, register with the society you’re representing.
Everyone gets two games each — your combined score decides your ranking.
The top player from each society moves on to an epic final round.
The final winner scores a mystery prize 🎁, and their society earns the ultimate clout for the term. 🫡

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We've reached the beginning of the 2nd half of the term. Wow. Incredible. Spectacular. Honestly, I don't know what to say besides I'm going crazy these days. (Please go circling 🙏)
