Hey! I'm Lucy one of the new secretaries ~~Help I have no idea what I'm doing~~

ANYWAY, we've got lots of FUN and EXCITING events lined up for week 1. Perfect to help you relax and wind down during exam period! :) 

Our amazing academics have also organised some **revision sessions** that you may find useful! We have **CS260** and **CS130** this week, but we have more planned so keep an eye out! 👀

The exec also still have two open positions for **gaming coordinators**! Nominations will be opening on Friday this week!

I hope everyone has recovered from the horrors of coursework ~~I haven't~~ and is ready to tackle the term of exams ~~I'm not~~. 

But seriously, exam periods can be tough and we want to make sure you are all doing ok. If you are struggling please get in contact with wellbeing services, or speak to one of our welfare officers: Serene (@thiswasdumb on Discord) or Raven (@raven0034 on Discord). You've got this!! :D
