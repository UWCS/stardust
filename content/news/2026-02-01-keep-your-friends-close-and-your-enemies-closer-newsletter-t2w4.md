Heard of that famous quote before? I live by it. ~~Actually, it's from the The Godfather Part II and often wrongly attributed to the Art of War by Sun Tzu.~~ I live by that quote. Hence why I keep my coursework at arm's length (I'm not a workaholic trust). 

Aside from that, we have a relatively chill week from the UWCS community so if you ever want a break from coursework or meet more people/hang out with friends COMEE.

*ONE MORE THING!*

AGM (elections) is coming soon (late term 2) so if anyone wants to run for any positions, feel free to reach out to any of us execs :)

# Welfare Notice
UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Tom (Discord tomo.li). We can also be reached via our email inbox at welfare@uwcs.co.uk.

You can speak to us at any time via Discord, email, and in-person (often in our exec hoodies), for advice, signposting and support. This can be for navigating the uni's support services, or to disclose something not right that happened due to someone's conduct at one of our events, and much more.

Any discussions you have will stay with the specific Welfare Officer, unless you permit otherwise.

#### 🕔 Fri 6th Feb 5pm - 6pm  📍 [Outside DCS](https://link.mazemap.com/AD7fblJv)
#### *"Break a leg guys"*
Weekly runs, open to all members and friends of UWCS. An average week might look like a 5k around campus on a pre-planned route, but as this is the first term for which the event is being run, expect to see a variety of ideas each week.

FOR ALL ABILITY LEVELS.

[Strava - UWCS Run Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1426021)

* Meet outside DCS at 17:00. Won't leave right away.

* Exec responsible are Zach (`doggy_w00f`) and Alfie (`brentfordarmy2398`)

Zach is very commited in this. He shouted run at me in a very ominous way when he passed by him with his bike. It's almost as if I was going to die as a result if I hadn't ran. (He tried recruiting me)

# [👾🎮 Friday Night Gaming (7pm till LateTM) 🎮👾](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/2/4/friday-night-gaming-(7pm-till-latetm)/)
#### 🕖 Fri 6th Feb 7pm - 5am  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *Only unlimited games and nothing else as it should be*
Friday Nights. Gaming. FNG. That's all we've known. PCs, consoles, VR, snacks and drinks. The pinnacle. The untoppable *and* unstoppable force. Sometimes you must choose between the last U1 and continuing Never Gonna Give You Up on Clone Hero. Your home for some beats? Aye, a worthy sacrifice.

Join us in DCS every Friday from 7pm, until you see Raven conked out on the floor from exhaustion sometime on Saturday.

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`), Sharvil (`w.0lf`), Laina (`vomitspawn`), and Santiago (`colombian.`) - if you need help or just wanna yap, come find us :)

We have our DCS account login - any game (including via Steam!) that you can get running, you can play. We also have several consoles, including Xboxes, PS4, Switch 1 & 2, Wii, along with our PCs which I call Nuke Machine and Microwave, which you can use our Valve Index on, play Clone Hero, and more! We also have board games for anybody wanting a less tech-based way to enjoy games :)

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

Hope to see you there :3 (Note: you don't have to be a DCS student to come along!)

I'm ALIVEEEEE despite being hit on the face by a football just now. Does anyone here know about the gay hockey show? If yes you should talk to our inclusivity officer about it. Bro is very passionate.

All in all, hope everyone is alive and not surviving on monster and drowning with coursework~

-Crystal (status is alive and questioning life I have many questions so do talk to me if you're curious)
