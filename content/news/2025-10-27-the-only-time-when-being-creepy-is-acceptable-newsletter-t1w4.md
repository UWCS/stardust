Hey everyone, Crystal here again :) I recovered from the hackathon (staying up for 34 hours is always a blessing). I hope everyone has recovered (if you joined the hackathon) and is not suffocating from coursework or monsters (yet). Also, don't forget that this Friday is Halloween; hence, it's the only acceptable time to be a creep(y) because that's my plan.

If you haven't already, it's a good idea to join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/uPVfUMeJX4) and follow our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/warwickcompsoc/) to keep up-to-date with all we're organising (including a lot of going outside!), talk to fellow students, get academic help, and much more!

#### *Post-WHACK Announcement...?!*
WHACK photos will be released at the end of this week!

# Welfare Notice

UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Thomas (Discord: tomo.li) - good chance you've seen us around already with the exec hoodies on, but especially since we have a lot of new people, we want to make ourselves known. You can speak to us in-person, or message us over Discord, and we can help give you advice and signpost when you're going through stuff, whether that's trying to navigate the various support systems within the uni, or something has happened involving a member of the society e.g. at an event, and more. Starting uni can especially be quite overwhelming; just know we're here to help, and it's okay to not be okay!

Weekly runs, open to all members and friends of UWCS. An average week might look like a 5k around campus on a pre-planned route, but as this is the first term for which the event is being run, expect to see a variety of ideas each week.

FOR ALL ABILITY LEVELS.

There is no excuse to not join. I participated with a cardigan, jacket, non-sport shoes, and jeans (and it was very NON APPROPRIATE but zach convinced me).

# [🎮 Friday Night Gaming (7pm till LateTM) 🎮](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/4/friday-night-gaming-(7pm-till-latetm)/)
#### 🕖 Fri 31st Oct 7pm - 2am  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *Games, unlimited games, but not games.*
The Friday night fun continues in unquestionably the best way to round off the week ~~Raven is definitely not biased in writing this~~, along with free snacks and drinks.

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`) and Sharvil (`w.0lf`) - come find us at any point if you need help, or even just to yap. We'll often be identifiable by our exec hoodies :)

We have a huge selection of fun activities for you to choose from, so come along for a great night :)

There are tons of options for consoles: Xbox with Rockband, Wii, Nintendo Switches (including a Switch 2!), PS4 and more—all having a huge variety of games.

If you are more into Steam, we have that too, just ask us for our DCS account login! Not only that, but you can get full access to the department computers and enjoy a wide selection of free games (wow!)

It doesn't stop there folks. We also have a ~~freaking~~ Oculus VR headset, so you can immerse yourself in Metaverse games. Beat Saber is a popular choice, but we have tons of options!

Did you think that was it? We even have Jackbox along with other party games that will continue through the night.

Hope to see you there :3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be honest, I can't believe it's week 4 already. Time really passes by quickly. Also I may or may not have survived the hackathon without anything but a single caffeine pill... I swear I might've been on the verge of death because I went for a TLDP concert the next day 💯 Also I HAVE MADE 80 INTERNSHIP APPLICATIONS SO FAR (this is not an achievement I don't have a single offer).

(PS gl with coursework and don't forget to enjoy halloween, sober or not)
