It's about time I wrote a newsletter... how long has it been? Well, good news I'm off hiatus and back to fuel the brainrot!

If you haven't been going to lectures, and instead you've been playing video games, usually I'd tell you that's a bad idea - but for once you can put your crippling video game addiction to good use, as the Warwick Speedrunning submissions deadline has been EXTENDED! The new deadline is Friday 17th January at 23:59, and you can submit your runs [here](https://oengus.io/marathon/wasd2025)

Last week was quiet for a reason... it only gets crazier from here.

And just as a reminder, we have our usual welfare officers always here to help you: Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034)
