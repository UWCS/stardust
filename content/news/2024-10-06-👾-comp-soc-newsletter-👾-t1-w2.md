Good evening everybody! This newsletter is brought to you by **Lucy** (the *evil* **secretary** >:) ).

I hope that the first week of term has treated you well. We've got lots of **exciting** events to fill up your *second week*, ranging from **academic** courses and talks to **circling** and even **football**?? 

Tickets to the **Warwick Hackathon** will be released this week - one of the biggest events of the year!

Was the first week not so great for you? Feeling home sick? Imposter syndrome? If **anything at all** is bothering you, feel free to reach out to our **welfare officers** on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034) - they will direct you to the support that you need. :)
