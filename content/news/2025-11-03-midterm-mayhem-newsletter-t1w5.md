Woah what is this unexpected email turning up in your inbox today? It must be the weekly Comp Soc newsletter. This week we'll be adding up to 8 new exec to the team in the **FREP ELECTIONS**, all of whom I will be immediately press-ganging into the role of writing the newsletter section for their teams every week.

*Extra note from Raven: Voting is now open as you read this, via [https://vote.uwcs.co.uk](https://vote.uwcs.co.uk), until Saturday 8th November 12:15am. If you have any issues, send an email across to [returning-officer@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:returning-officer@uwcs.co.uk). Also, apologies for the lateness of this newsletter, something may have been borked by me in `sec-scripts` lmao*

With more exec than ever, we're hosting even more events, so it's good to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NTDKwvakm6) and follow our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/warwickcompsoc/) to keep up-to-date with all we're organising from academic support to acclimatising to the outside world.

# Welfare Notice

UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: `raven0034`) and Thomas (Discord: `tomo.li`) - good chance you've seen us around already with the exec hoodies on, but especially since we have a lot of new people, we want to make ourselves known. You can speak to us in-person, or message us over Discord, and we can help give you advice and signpost when you're going through stuff, whether that's trying to navigate the various support systems within the uni, or something has happened involving a member of the society e.g. at an event, and more. Starting uni can especially be quite overwhelming, just know we're here to help, and it's okay to not be okay!

Sometimes you hear the fluttering of the wings of a raven through a gentle breeze, sometimes you witness a microwave PC almost being accidentally upgraded to Windows 11 purely via drumpads, but three things are guaranteed in life: death, taxes, and LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!

Happening in 2 consecutive weeks, we are scheming up schedules, collabs, opportunities to contribute and far more!

Speaking of which, [fill out our form](https://forms.gle/pDV6zNcjPh1rMmLa7) if you'd like to see something specific on the schedule, or if you'd like to lend a hand in setup, running any events etc - it'll be an awesome opportunity to get involved!

__You can bring your PCs, consoles, games and more, all is welcome at LAN!__ 

**IMPORTANT: We have a planned schedule of events, and it's not required to bring your own devices to participate in LAN**

See the schedule [here](https://i.postimg.cc/3JptscMV/bfsl-part-1-schedule.png)!

And yes, pizza, snacks, drinks and vast arrays of entertainment inbound :3

If you want to know more about what LAN is, or have any other questions, we have a **LAN guide** you can check out over at: [https://uwcs.co.uk/about/lan/](https://uwcs.co.uk/about/lan). If there's something not covered there, give the Gaming Coordinators a shout in our LAN channel on [our Discord](https://discord.uwcs.uk) and we'll be sure to help! You can also reach us via email at [gaming@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:gaming@uwcs.co.uk)

What do you mean the newsletter is late? I would never do such a thing! My dissertation is just slowly killing me and application season is back with a vengeance (so if you're aso suffering, I wish you  the best of luck)
