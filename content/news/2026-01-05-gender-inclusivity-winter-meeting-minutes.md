# Agenda (Minutes Next Section)
Note:
- Raven Lucia (RL)

## Agenda I: Term 1 Feedback Form Info By Welfare (points by RL)
- Inclusion
   - 100% responded “yes” to the safe, welcome & included general question
      - RL: Yay! Worth noting that there's always things we can be doing better and the responses aren't necessarily reflective of everyone in the soc, but it's a good sign!
      - Massive praise given for Wildcards Events
- Events
   - All responses very satisfied - only event category that achieved this :0
   - All responses "yes" to the soc being a safe & inclusive space for gender minorities
      - RL: Worth noting that whilst this is definitely positive and improvement over previous, worth not letting it lull us into a false sense of security
   - Points from respondents:
      - Wildcards is a very inclusive and fun place, and the inclusivity officers are doing a great job
      - Would be nice to occasionally see wildcards pub meal or movie nights - pref times which aren't just Wednesday afternoons
      - Praise to some of the other exec given on inclusion of gender minorities (gaming given explicit shout-out)
      - Society can be quite intimidating to get involved with - inherently exacerbated by male-dominated nature of exec and soc as a whole. Introduction to 2 male pres' and a male social sec noted as an exacerbating factor
      - Wildcards are more likely to engage with e.g. the pub traversals if there's at least one of the sober exec that isn't a man
         - RL: Links in to why I had concerns at the start of the exec cycle about 2 male-presenting welfare officers - broadly good that Wildcards is functional and acting as a safe space compared to previously, helps partially mitigate this issue
      - Wildcards has helped getting to know multiple exec, in turn has improved confidence of going to other soc events
      - Recommendations for more non-men exec to attend wildcards events esp at the start of a year - more friendly faces → new members can recognise them and feel more comfortable at other events
      - Particularly, a respondent said that it helped them integrate with the society, having felt like the Welcome Talk was fun, but presented the appearance of an insular group
      - Wildcards makes the soc & other events seem less scary, esp knowing other Wildcards will be attending

## Agenda II: Events
- Reflection on Term 1 Events
   - RL: Try to avoid clashes e.g. like what happened with Wildcards n Chill clashing with Ada Lovelace day and MW event

## Agenda I: Feedback 
- Very positive feedback, it's on the agenda/main feedback document
    - Don't let the good feedback allow you to get more relaxed
- Responding to feedback should happen so members know what's happening/will think it's worth their time doing

## Agenda II: Events
- Will try to avoid clashes (e.g. Ada Lovelace day) going forwards
- Events need to be added to the website
    - Even if they're not 100% finalised with details, add them to the website as draft so exec can see 
- Events for the term already somewhat planned
- feedback suggestions
    - More variance in times
    - Wildcard pub meal/gaming nights etc
- Karaoke/Just Dance could be a non-sober event
    - Be careful with equipment

## Agenda III: Frep Inclusion
- Generally happy
- Would like to help run more events, like ball
    - Speak to Willow
