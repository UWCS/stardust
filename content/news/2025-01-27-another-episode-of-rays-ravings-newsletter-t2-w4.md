I've stolen Raven's bit... shhh don't tell them. 

I hope you've recovered well from pub golf, because we're back with our usual events this week. And some additional news: Warwick Speedrunning is back in less than two weeks! The schedule has been released, so head over to the Speedrunning server [here](https://discord.gg/ATSQAcdwtr) to see what we'll be up to. 

And just as a reminder, we have our usual welfare officers always here to help you: Serene (@thiswasdumb) and Raven (@raven0034)
