I'm Crystal, hi -- your latest newsletter factory worker :o ie Secretary. I'll be your manufacturer for every other newsletter this year!

Anyways, I hope exams are going well and your mental sanity is still intact because mine is kinda falling apart after 118 and 130. All I can see are predicates in sentences, humans as objects, and nightmares of data structures failing. Not even a war veteran feels an ounce of my pain and suffering after this week. If you're feeling the same way, we have some great events lined up this week 🙏

As always, we have our wonderful Welfare Officers here to help you if you encounter any issues: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034)

#### *Quack Quack Quack*

I was gonna quack a duck joke here, but all the ones I googled were actually so bad - who came up with this??: "What do you call an exploding duck? A firequacker" 🦆💥

Regardless of the lack of good duck jokes, pub meal will still commence at The Dirty Duck this week.

I wanna have an eternal nap after that 118 and 130 grind. Spamming java and an arcane crip sheet in the last week was not ok - Crystal
