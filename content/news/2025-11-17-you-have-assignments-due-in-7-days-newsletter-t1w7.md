Dearest fellow University of Warwick Claycroft Swings (UWCS) members, sorry if the title gave you a heart attack - but maybe you *do* have an assignment due in 7 days. We have a suspiciously calm week this week (seems like the inclusivity events are corrupting the rest of the society), but don't let that fool you into thinking the fools running these events will make any of them calm.

# Welfare Notice

UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: `raven0034`) and Thomas (Discord: `tomo.li`) - good chance you've seen us around already with the exec hoodies on, but especially since we have a lot of new people, we want to make ourselves known. You can speak to us in-person, or message us over Discord, and we can help give you advice and signpost when you're going through stuff, whether that's trying to navigate the various support systems within the uni, or something has happened involving a member of the society e.g. at an event, and more. Starting uni can especially be quite overwhelming, just know we're here to help, and it's okay to not be okay!

# [👽 Next to Normal & Chill! 👽](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/7/next-to-normal-&-chill!/)
#### 🕒 Wed 19th Nov 3pm - 5pm  📍 [CS0.07](https://link.mazemap.com/NevzJ5kL)
#### *Normal? In my CompSoc? I doubt it*
Wanna cry for two hours straight? Not to worry, our watching of the Next to Normal pro-shot will do just that!

Not convinced by watching the best musical ever™️? Perhaps some free drinks may convince you.......

I recommend not knowing anything about the musical, but be aware there are some significant trigger warnings, so look them up as you need :)

# [🏃 Run Club 🏃](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/7/run-club/)
#### 🕔 Fri 21st Nov 5pm - 6pm  📍 [Outside DCS](https://link.mazemap.com/AD7fblJv)
#### *Ideas dreamt up by the utterly deranged*
Weekly runs, open to all members and friends of UWCS. An average week might look like a 5k around campus on a pre-planned route, but as this is one of the terms of all time in which the event is being run, expect to see a variety of ideas each week. Last week we ran circles in the middle of an amber weather warning, maybe this week will be calmer?

FOR ALL ABILITY LEVELS.

[Strava - UWCS Run Club](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1426021)

* Meet outside (or inside if it's raining) DCS at 17:00. Won't leave right away.

* Exec responsible are Zach (`doggy_w00f`) and Alfie (`brentfordarmy2398`)

# [🎮 Friday Night Gaming 🎮](http://events.uwcs.co.uk/2025/1/7/friday-night-gaming/)
#### 🕖 Fri 21st Nov 7pm - Late^TM  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *Somehow everyone survived BIG FUCKING LAN?*
The Friday night fun continues in unquestionably the best way to round off the week ~~Raven is definitely not biased in writing this~~, along with free snacks and drinks.

**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!

The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`) and Sharvil (`w.0lf`), and our new Gaming Freps are Laina (`vomitgrrrl`) and Santiago (`colombian.`) - come find us at any point if you need help, or even just to yap. We'll often be identifiable by our exec hoodies :)

We have a huge selection of fun activities for you to choose from, so come along for a great night :)

There are tons of options for consoles: Xbox with Rockband, Wii, Nintendo Switches (including a Switch 2!), PS4 and more—all having a huge variety of games.

If you are more into Steam, we have that too, just ask us for our DCS account login! Not only that, but you can get full access to the department computers and enjoy a wide selection of free games (wow!)

It doesn't stop there folks. We also have a ~~freaking~~ Oculus VR headset, so you can immerse yourself in Metaverse games. Beat Saber is a popular choice, but we have tons of options!

Did you think that was it? We even have Jackbox along with other party games that will continue through the night.

Hope to see you there :3
