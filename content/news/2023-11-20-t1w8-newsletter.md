Second years have their C͟S͟2͟6͟0͟ ͟A͟l͟g͟o͟r͟i͟t͟h͟m͟s͟ ͟e͟x͟a͟m͟ on *Monday* at **5pm**. We know this, we know you are worried and stressed.

So, we have decided to host a revision session just two days prior to help you prepare for the exam!

We will have our academic officers *(**big** thank you to them)* preparing a bit of a revision session for anyone planning to attend, so you will hopefully feel prepared for the exam. Any questions can be answered on the day :)
