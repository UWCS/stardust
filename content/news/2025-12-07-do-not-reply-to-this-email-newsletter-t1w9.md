It's Monday, which means a meandering mess of messages about the week ahead has landed in your inbox. Open it up, read all about it, maybe attend some of the events. But savour it, there's only one more newsletter to come this term. It's a busy week, with everyone eager to run their events before the year is over, so let's get started.

# Welfare Notice
UWCS has 2 Welfare Officers: Raven (Discord: raven0034) and Thomas (Discord: tomo.li) - good chance you've seen us around already with the exec hoodies on, but especially since we have a lot of new people, we want to make ourselves known. You can speak to us in-person, or message us over Discord, and we can help give you advice and signpost when you're going through stuff, whether that's trying to navigate the various support systems within the uni, or something has happened involving a member of the society e.g. at an event, and more. Starting uni can especially be quite overwhelming, just know we're here to help, and it's okay to not be okay!

You'll leave with a clearer understanding of why system design makes you a stronger developer.  The talk will conclude with a Q&A.

Weekly runs, open to all members and friends of UWCS.

Cold, dark, damp, miserable. \#BringYourFavouriteLecturer

#### 🕖 Fri 5th Dec 7pm - 2am  📍 [CS0.03](https://link.mazemap.com/wASW9d7d)
#### *The only day of the week when gaming is allowed*
The Friday night fun continues in unquestionably the best way to round off the week ~~Raven is definitely not biased in writing this~~, along with free snacks and drinks.



**Important:** FNG is a sober event, please don't bring alcohol in, or you will be asked to leave.

**Also Important:** Make sure to tidy up after yourself before leaving, the department does a great kindness in letting us run this event, preferably we stay on their good side!



The Gaming Coordinators this year are: Raven (`raven0034`), Rob (`spooky3142`), Lyon (`keyboardsky`), Arda (`mangowizard`) and Sharvil (`w.0lf`) - come find us at any point if you need help, or even just to yap. We'll often be identifiable by our exec hoodies :)



We have a huge selection of fun activities for you to choose from, so come along for a great night :)



There are tons of options for consoles: Xbox with Rockband, Wii, Nintendo Switches (including a Switch 2!), PS4 and more—all having a huge variety of games.



If you are more into Steam, we have that too, just ask us for our DCS account login! Not only that, but you can get full access to the department computers and enjoy a wide selection of free games (wow!)



It doesn't stop there folks. We also have a ~~freaking~~ Oculus VR headset, so you can immerse yourself in Metaverse games. Beat Saber is a popular choice, but we have tons of options!



Did you think that was it? We even have Jackbox along with other party games that will continue through the night.



Hope to see you there :3

There will be chill, casual, friendly, relaxed, informal, non-competitive, leisurely, no pressure games of badminton at the Westwood Games Hall, open to all abilities. Borrow a racquet or bring your own.

Maybe we should take replies to the newsletter. We need somewhere where you can complain about mistakes in the newsletter, or the overly familiar tone that varies from offputting to creepy throughout. In the meantime, shout your complaints into the aether or at anyone wearing a UWCS hoodie. And if you really hate the newsletters, have a go at writing one yourself, maybe you might just like it!
