Sorting out events for the next term :) 

<!-- more --> 

## Agenda I: Circles

* **Number of Events** 

  * Looking to do 1 circle and 1 other drinking event in term 3 due to it being exam season 
* **Theme**

  * Pyjamas 
  * In a field
* **When/Where**

  * Would have to be after exam season - hosting in a field means it needs to be warm 
  * w/b 17th June (T3W9) as the provisional date 
  * Held in a field avoids the SU circling booking process

    * Risk assessment needs to be completed
    * Need to find a field with bathroom access 

      * Windmill hill (bathrooms in Cryfield accommodation
      * Field outside varsity 
* **Contingencies**

  * Unreliable weather forecast this far in advance 
  * Announce the week of the event early, and pick a specific day once we have a more reliable forecast

    * Ideally it would be held on Wednesday (POP), but this is non-essential
  * Look into the cost and logistics of hiring a gazebo 

## Agenda II: Other Drinking Events

* **Pub Traversal** 

  * Held in term 3 Week 4

    * Towards the end of the week (probably Friday or Saturday)
* **Pub golf** 

  * Would be done in groups 
* **Tenpin bowling** 

  * Alcohol is sold on site, however there are probably restrictions in place 

    * Could have forfeits for varying things, for example getting the ball in the gutter 
  * Unfortunately we can't get a colleague discount for the whole group - prices aren't extreme anyway
* **Shot Chess**

  * Self explanatory 
  * Term 1 next academic year

## Agenda III: Non-alcoholic Events

* **Barbeque**

  * Location - On Campus 

    * There are bookable barbeques around campus (such as behind Claycroft)

      * Would need to be thoroughly cleaned before using
      * Removes the need for disposable barbeques
    * Outdoor event form must be completed alongside barbeque booking 

      * The notice time for this varies based on attendance (20 - 50 = 10 days, 50+ = 28 days)
  * Holding on a weekend would work best to avoid clashing with exams 

    * Saturday exams are possible, worth looking at exam timetables when they're released to see possible clashes 
    * Can realistically be held on any day in the evening 
  * Logistics/Catering - put out a form (or tickets through the SU) to get numbers and dietary requirements 

    * It's possible people wouldn't submit a form and would turn up expecting to be catered for, any better alternatives? 
    * Get a budget from the treasurers before shopping 
    * Do most/all of the shopping at costco if possible, as we're buying a lot - a "shitload" of meat, bread, snacks, monster(!!!)

      * This would require a car to transport everything back 
* **The Chase, lecturer edition**

  * Held around term 1 week 3

    * One of the first society events for the freshers after freshers' week - there was a lot of engagement from freshers to the quizzes this year 
    * Is before coursework deadlines -> higher turnout 
  * Can be held in a lecture theatre

    * Possibly in the oculus, will need to be booked 
    * Can have a full scale setup 
  * Contact DCS:

    * See if they are able to sponsor the event 
    * Get interest from professors to act as the chasers 
  * Playing for yourself/playing for charity? 
* **Bake Off**

  * Term 1 
  * Should be held when its raining more as it's an inside event 
  * Towards the end of the term 
  * Location

    * Last years bake off was sponsored by the Oaks 
    * They won't financially sponsor this year 
    * Need to check we can still use their kitchens if needs be
    * Can research on campus event spaces and see if any have large catering kitchens 
* **Charity Casino Night**

  * When?

    * Term 3 week 2 (after the dissertation deadline) - possibly 4th May 
    * Probably being moved to Term 1 to avoid clashes with deadlines and other events 
  * Logistics 

    * Do a flat fee buy in, which stops people from overspending (and blowing their life savings gambling)
    * Get a set amount of tokens for the flat fee 
  * Equipment 

    * Physics, Stats and Maths did a casino themed event and may still have equipment we can borrow 
    * Poker & Mafia societies on campus may have equipment/experience they are willing to loan out
* **Alton Towers Trip**

  * When?

    * End of term 3 (no specific date mentioned)

      * Plan to avoid rain - unfortunately weather forecast is unreliable this far in advance 
    * Make sure it's outside of holiday time for primary and secondary schools (this is peak time for Alton Towers and will mean more expensive tickets) 
  * Logistics 

    * Large number of attendees are expected, so transport would likely be a coach 

      * 2 hour drive each way in a coach, so should leave campus at 8:30-9am to get there shortly after gates open 
    * Initially, get a quote from Alton Towers for large group ticket prices. Submit this to the SU to get event approved, then start selling tickets. 

      * Once tickets close, start paying all of the services, etc. 
      * If we sell more tickets than the quote, this isn't a problem, as tickets are likely cheaper for higher numbers 
    * Tickets will be sold through the SU website, meaning an events planning pack must be done (2 weeks before the event)

      * Need to start planning ASAP 

## Agenda IV: Training

* Event planning training etc on the SU website
* Do your training guys!!
