# The beginning of the end | Newsletter T3W4

As the break from April exams come to an end, I believe most of us are burying our heads in past exam papers and swimming in pools of 1s and 0s. If you're like me, you would've dragged your sorry ahh to all the revision lectures only to realise that you don't understand anything and that everything is hieroglyphic. If you're one of the lucky ones, you still have new content (especially those overcatting nerds-- I mean hardworkers). Anyways, if you ever need to see society again, come to our following events!

As always, we have our wonderful Welfare Officers here to help you if you encounter any issues: Thomas (@tomo.li) and Raven (@raven0034)

#### *Quack Quack Quack Quack* 

I was gonna quack a duck joke here, but all the ones I googled were actually so bad - who came up with this??: "What do you call an exploding duck? A firequacker" 🦆💥

Regardless of the lack of good duck jokes, pub meal will still commence at The Dirty Duck this week.

#### *Transfer exam pain to physical pain*
Weekly runs, open to all members and friends of UWCS. An average week might look like a 5k around campus on a pre-planned route, but as this is the first term for which the event is being run, expect to see a variety of ideas each week.

FOR ALL ABILITY LEVELS.

We also have a UWCS Strava!

The Friday night fun continues! Please note that the default ending time for FNG this term is 1am to accommodate for exams!

We have a huge selection of fun activities for you to choose from, so come along for a great night :)

There are tons of options for consoles: Xbox with Rockband, Wii, Nintendo Switches, PS4 and more—all having a huge variety of games.

If you are more into Steam, we have that too! Not only that, but you can get full access to the department computers and enjoy a wide selection of free games (wow!)

It doesn't stop there folks. We also have a freaking Oculus VR headset, so you can immerse yourself in Metaverse games. Beat Saber is a popular choice, but we have tons of options!

Did you think that was it? We even have J͟a͟c͟k͟b͟o͟x͟, along with other party games that will continue through the night.

If you find yourself available, pop by for Friday Night Gaming and enjoy this huge range of options!
