It's your favourite Impostor Secretary Raven, celebrating the anniversary of my first newsletter! There seems to have been an emergency evacuation at the Newsletter Factory, but the workers are safe and having some R&R, don't worry! In the meantime I'll do my best Saul impression: And that's why I (fight) write newsletters for you (Albuquerque) UWCS! Speaking of Saul, this is a perfect segue into the next section, because you, in fact, have rights!

# UWCS is Boycotting Warwick's Pride Month Events

First of all, I wish it were under better circumstances, but **happy Pride Month!**

There has been quite a bit of noise about the university's decision, without appropriate prior consultation with students and staff, to attempt to implement changes to the Trans Inclusion Policy. These changes are now "under review", after student and staff backlash.

These changes would have revoked the ability for trans students to use toilets corresponding to their gender, as well as encouraging confrontational approaches to enforce this. Whilst this was targeted at trans people, this would have also had major impacts on many people (including cis people), effectively encouraging bullying, harassment and worse if someone were deemed to be not masc/fem presenting enough to use the corresponding toilets.

After discussion and voting amongst exec, we have decided to support the statement made in conjunction with various societies, which you can read [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ6lTOOoQb3/?igsh=MXRmeWd3enl6OGJwYg==), which has more full details.

If you wish to sign this yourself and/or e.g. on a society's behalf see [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScdPTHOFmVub8eim5JQAvY2p407K0TYPQSvvjJ5ha3siICwGw/viewform).

Whilst we generally do not have much involvement in the University's Pride Month Events as a society, we want to re-affirm our support for our trans members, the safety for all, and to explicitly state that **we do not agree with the University's approach to this issue as outlined**. Please note that **this is specifically a boycott against the *University's* Pride Month Events**, and this will **not** impact our recognition of Pride Month.

If you have been impacted by this issue, please feel free to reach out on Discord to me (@raven0034) or Thomas (@tomo.li), or drop an email to [welfare@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:welfare@uwcs.co.uk) - know **you are supported and are not alone**.

# Merch

Thanks to everybody who placed an order for this year's merch! Fear not, the orders are being processed, and we'll be in touch as soon as we have any updates :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Right, now all of that is out the way, let's actually talk about this week's events!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [üçî Pub Meal üçî](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/pub-duck/)
#### üïñ Mon 2nd June 7pm - 9pm  üìç[The Dirty Duck](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c889c421e6f5928c0d39a?projectId=warwick)
#### *Clearly no-one told the duck about the showers in MSB hmm*

After a failed attempt last time because of bank holiday, we go back to the Duck for the third and last time of this term!

Unfortunately, I don't think it's as likely we'll manage to bag free food at the Duck, like has mysteriously happened more than once at Phoach this term. Nevertheless, come along, have a break from exams and yap over some food and drink! And who knows, maybe we'll top the conversations of last week from guinea pigs to representing conversations as trees ~~tbf that was just me but shhh i am a very normal person~~.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [ üìö CS139 Revision Session üìö ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w7/cs139-revision-session/)
#### üïï Tuesday 3rd June 5pm - 7pm üìç[MS.01](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c88f9421e6f5928c0e669?projectId=warwick)
#### *Unfortunately, you don't learn about Apache Attack Helicopters in the CS degree (better than the Apache Server)*

Centring divs might give you nightmares, Flask may not be your favourite type of flask, and maybe you swear by CS(R)S (Computing Society Revision Sessions).

In any case, come along to the session to conquer the jungle of web development before the exam!

~~Seriously though, why couldn't we leave it at [this](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/). Maybe this should be how our website should look, would save so many headaches (shout-out to stardust x)~~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [ üèÉ UWCS Run Club üèÉ ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/uwcs-run-club/)
#### üïî Friday 6th June 5pm - 6:30pm üìç[Outside DCS](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8858421e6f5928c0c78f?projectId=warwick)
#### *tbf it is Pride Month, some of us can show off our speedwalking skills*

The successful UWCS Run Club returns, having done weekly 5K runs throughout this term hosted by the Sports Officers on a variety of routes! Whether it's building the leg muscles up or getting the rage ~~against the machine~~ energy that's built up over exam season, come along for a run ~~or walk~~ - this is open to all ability levels!

Meet Zach and Alfie outside DCS at 5pm, avoid the temptation of eating the grass (we can't all be geese!), and clock in that extra distance1

UWCS has a Strava that you should join [here](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1426021)!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# [ üéÆ Friday Night Gaming üéÆ ](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/repeat/fng/)
#### üïñ Friday 6th June 7pm - 1am üìç[CS Department](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8858421e6f5928c0c78f)
#### *aaaa the voices are in my head again- oh wait no it's just the karaoke going again*

Some of our gamers took a flight case to Costco since we didn't have a car to hand this time, and we don't live in GTA so we can't just steal one and get away with it ~~probably~~. I have a theory we could attach rocket boosters to it next time to speed up the process, or maybe we could experiment with a cannon, because yano who doesn't like eating snack grains - CRISP SAND!

So yeah, come grab some free food, yap, enjoy some games, queue some cool songs, and hey, maybe I'll actually do Jackbox this week - we kinda got bogged down with the second attempt at our LAN planning meeting, which we pulled off this time! There'll be more info soon, but it will be happening **20th - 22nd June** (Week 9 weekend), and I'm sure working an open day in the middle of the event ~~for the second year in a row~~ will not cause any sanity issues whatsoever!!

FNG is once again ending at **1am** to accommodate for exams, sorry for the inconvenience!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Phew, there we go! Good luck with any more exams, and hope we can see y'all at our events (don't forget the Events Officer by-election!)!

I don't know when the network will let me produce the next episode of Raven's Ravings, but until next time, peace out ‚úåÔ∏è

~ Raven :3
