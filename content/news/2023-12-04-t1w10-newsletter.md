It is a Ricky and Morty reference. If you haven't seen the video, please watch it. If you have, ~vibes~

We have heard the calls for calcium, we know the effects that have developed. We heard and we listened, so we have brought back *Milk Monday* once a month, with it being the start of each month so we can bring **chocolate milk**.

You should **definitely** consider our typical weekly events (might get some special snacks for last week of term ofc): *Comp Cafe* and *Friday Night Gaming*

Besides that, we've got some special events you probably would like: *DCS Xmas Social* and *UWCS vs League Soc Charity Showmatch*. Both are a great opportunity to kick back, relax, and enjoy your time in DCS after all the stress of coursework!!

I know some of you are stressing, so please do take the opportunities to get some free snacks and relax while you can!
