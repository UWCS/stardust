# Agenda (Minutes Next Section)
Note:
- Raven Lucia (RL)

## Agenda I: Term 1 Feedback Form Info By Welfare (points by RL)
- Comms
   - Run Club praised for good comms
- Events
   - All responses satisfied
   - Only other comment was "RUN CLUB WOOOOOOOOOO (ignore that I've not been coming recently)"
    - RL: RUN CLUB WOOOOOOOOOO indeed

## Agenda II: Events
- Reflection on Term 1 Events
   - RL: Minor note - some stuff e.g. WBL didn’t make it to the same info sources (e.g. newsletter, events website). Helpful to do for accessibility & consistency

- Term 2 Event plans
   - RL: Connected to other note, pls make sure stuff like football makes it onto the events website (tennis already there as a draft event)
