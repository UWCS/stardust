HELLO PEOPLE (and other...). It's Lucy writing this week's newsletter <3

Apart from our _regular_ events (like pub and FNG) and our _courses_ that have been running for a few weeks (X-Soc Python and C) we are also playing **table tennis** at this week's **Sport Saturday** which I am _personally_ very excited for.

In addition, the much awaited **WHACK** is starting this _Saturday_ - the **biggest** event of the year. To all those who got tickets (not me rip), there will be **24 hours** of fun events, free food and most importantly: **coding**! We are also giving away over **£2.8k** worth of prizes!

If you are struggling with anything, please get in contact with one of our welfare officers on Discord: Serene (@thiswasdumb) or Raven (@raven0034)! :)
