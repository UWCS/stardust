Halloween is officially over, Mariah Carey music better start playing.

<!-- more -->

We have officially entered Christmas season, so buckle up :D 

The first gift our society can offer is **chocolate milk** because the first Monday of the month is here! 

We can also offer some networking and careers talks if you'd like to try and get on Qube's or Apple's good sides and maybe set up some internships, y'know 👀

You should definitely try and pass by our trip to *Birmingham Christmas Market*! We will go around the market together and just enjoy whatever they offer (i wouldn't know i'm not a local so i don't really know what christmas markets have)!
