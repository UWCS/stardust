In computing, the term "LAN" stands for Local Area Network. In our case, it refers to our flagship gaming event where we gather a bunch of computers and hook them together to one router and play games together for an entire weekend (well, a full 48 hours). These usually take place once each term, where we reasonably have the capacity to run them.

## Bringing a device

> We cannot accept any liability for the security of personal devices or their data at LAN. **If at any point you plan to step away from your device, please ensure to lock your devices, even if it's for a short while.**

We welcome a wide range of devices at LAN, from gaming laptops, to consoles old and new, to gargantuan desktops! You don't have to bring your own devices to participate in LAN, but absolutely feel free to!

If you need a hand, or some general advice about transporting your setup, have a chat to us through our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk)!

We'll provide cables for networking, i.e. Ethernet, but anything else you'll be expected to bring yourself. This includes monitors, cables, power bricks, controllers, and so on. Don't be that one person who forgets their mouse!

#### Desktops

Where we're able to, we'll offer a pick-up service to transport your desktop to LAN. You'll know if we're running this via `#announcements` on our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk).

We can also aim to lend desktop tower carrying cases, monitor bags and potentially other bits to help you out.

You'll want to bring a monitor, but keep in mind you're limited to **bringing one monitor**.

We want to be mindful of the events and people at LAN, so **bring headphones rather than speakers**.

## What else should you bring?

- Snacks (we'd bankrupt the society trying to feed everyone)
- Money (woooo snacks, or maybe you can pitch in with Milk Midnight)
- Pillow
- Yourself, in an orderly, hygienic state, for the sake of being mindful to those at the event

We recommend using `#lan` on our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk) to find out what people are planning on bringing, so you can plan ahead. In very lucky circumstances, we may have additional PCs from sponsors, but this is rare.

Also, LAN is a strictly sober event. **Please do not bring alcohol to the venue otherwise you will be asked to leave**.

You will also be told to leave if the exec team believes you are in an unfit state to participate. Outside of potential damage to very expensive equipment, there have been notable incidents involving alcohol at LANs in the past: we do not wish to replicate them.

If you have any concerns, get in touch with the Welfare Officers, either in-person, or via our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk), or at [welfare@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:welfare@uwcs.co.uk).

## What do we bring?

- A *lot*. We bring over a lot of the equipment you'd typicall see at Friday Night Gaming - the consoles, VR Headsets and more!

- Amphi has been retired, and on its way out it almost cost us a rather large sum of money. Fear not, for we have a new music server ~~again~~: **RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAmphi**! Hopefully, it gets used for more than just Jackie's Box, but hey, sometimes we gotta temper our expectations a little. Anyway, you'll be able submit your favourite """music""" here!

- Snacks, more snacks, even more snacks, sometimes milk, and often pizza when we do our quiz!

- Just enough sanity to hold everything together for 48 hours, hopefully without a repeat of e.g. Alarm LAN.

## What we do

First and foremost, **we game**. And we eat our fair share of junk food.

But we also host special events throughout the LAN which aim to get anyone and everyone involved. Here's what you can expect from a typical LAN...

- **Tournaments** - From Mario Kart to Super Smash Bros, put your skills to the test!

- **Film Nights** - Why not take a break from gaming, sit down, and watch a couple of classic films?

- **Quizzes** - Teams of four, five-or-so rounds, ideally get as many questions right as possible.

- **Society Collabs** - We've done Smash with NinSoc, Ultra Hardcore Minecraft with MineSoc... the list goes on!

But this is not an exhaustive list. Be sure to check our schedule to see what exciting events we've got going on!

## Where we LAN

Typically, **LIB2** at the Library is our go-to spot for LAN.

Not sure where LIB2 is? All good!
- You can see LIB2's location on [campus.warwick.ac.uk](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c88f2421e6f5928c0e4ec?projectId=warwick).

- Facing the front of the library builing, go down to the right side, past the CafÃ©. You'll see a sliding door with a card reader, so you'll need your Student ID card to enter. Once you're inside, go through the left-hand set of doors, then straight ahead. Congrats! You've just made it to LAN!

> Note: The door to LIB2 will reject your card after 10pm. Don't worry if this happens, there will be at least one exec member available to let you in, just let us know you're here on our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk).

## Frequently asked questions

<br>

#### Aaah! I'm at LAN and something's broken!

Um, that's not a question, but don't panic! We'll have members of the exec team to hand who can lend their help (plus maybe some tools) if your computer encounters any issues at LAN.

#### Can I sleep at LAN?

We wouldn't encourage it. Generally speaking, security gets upset when people do this, but regardless, we doubt you'd be able to sleep comfortably in the room (chair bed LAN though...). Instead, maybe head home to catch up on rest ~~or just neck down some pure caffeine in true gamer spirit~~.

#### If I go, do I have to stay for the entire LAN?

Nope! Feel free to head out if and when you need to eat, sleep, or just go outside (highly recommended actually, Vitamin D go brrr). We will always have at least one exec member inside the room to make sure your stuff stays safe during the event. That being said, if you'd like to head off early, that's totally fine. It would be pretty irresponsible of us to hold you hostage, after all.

#### Is there a limit on how many devices I can bring?

While we don't have a hard limit on devices, we suggest that people are sensible about the devices they bring. We would recommend *one* computer or console, plus a monitor, hence using two sockets.

#### Can I bring an extension cord?

Yes, but please only use it on the outlets on the walls of the room. **DO NOT plug extension cords into the electrical leads coming down from the ceiling**. These are not designed to handle them, and doing so could lead to potential fire risk (and a return of the dreaded Alarm LAN). These should provide more than enough plugs anyway.

#### I still need help!

No worries. Hop on our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk) and ask any member of our current Gaming Coordinators if there's anything else you'd like to know about LAN. I promise we won't bite. You can also send us an email at [gaming@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:gaming@uwcs.co.uk), or follow our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/warwickcompsoc/) for updates.

In fact, Discord tends to be our best source of info regarding events in UWCS, so be sure to join to get the *very latest* updates on our various happenings - you can grab the `Lanlubbers` role to get live updates on events!

We look forward to seeing you at our next LAN!
