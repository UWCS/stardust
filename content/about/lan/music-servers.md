title = "History of LAN music servers"
+++

*\"One of the LAN traditions is the music server. The main LAN
computer - dijkstra - powers LAN and also a web interface to which
members can queue whatever YouTube video they like. As you can imagine,
this resolves in an \'interesting\' mixture of content - from actual
good music to horrible outdated memes.*

*The content of the music server is not the discussion here, however.
Instead, we focus on the software running the server itself. For the
majority of CompSoc\'s lifetime, the software has been pretty standard
and lasted a while. More recently, however, there has been an arms race
to create the next big server by many members. Today we will document
every music server created for LAN by CompSoc members.*

*Heed my warning, however, for herein lies the path of madness. Many
have tried to create a music server and many have failed - notice the
large amount of unfinished and/or unnamed servers in this list. Should
future exec hear rumors of the underlings attempting to stage a music
server-based coup, please add their name to the hall of shame here.*

*Enjoy.\"*
