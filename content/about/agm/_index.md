# AGM INFO STUFF
### What happens at an AGM?

An AGM, or Annual General Meeting, must be held in Term 2 by every society. It's not always called that, but it's meant to be an event where the society looks back on the year's events, and looks forward to how it wants to plan things in the future.

This is a great event, and can be quite entertaining. At the AGM we do 5 things:

- the annual report (exec talk for a really long time about all the events we ran)
- run society elections (hopeful exec talk for a really long time about events they want to run ~~but won't get round to~~)
- vote on motions (~~idiots~~ members request **normal** things of a computing society and there is *NO* joking about)
- spend all of our sponsor money on pizza
- get kicked out of the room by Community Safety because they want to close the building

Why are we doing this? Because we're a Warwick SU society and have to follow [Regulation 9](https://www.warwicksu.com/your-union/how-the-su-works/governingdocuments/), and also because it would also be really nice to have an exec for next year.

### Where and When is our AGM?

*Place:* **Physics Lecture Theatre (PLT)** \
*Date/Time:* **6pm February 26th**

### Who can take part in the AGM?

Any member of the society! Even if you're not standing, how you vote or what you say could drastically affect the direction the society takes in future.

### Voting

We use the STV, or [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) system. For each position, you can rank as many candidates as you want in order of preference. The system works in elimination rounds. If your preferred candidate is eliminated, your vote will be transferred to your next non-eliminated preference until a single candidate remains.

You can also vote to Re-Open Nominations, by selecting a candidate affectionately labeled as RON. Note that RON is an active vote against any candidates below that option, so you should only use RON if you feel the alternative really is that bad ~~(e.g. they don't show up to the AGM)~~.

We'll be using our online voting platform, [UWCS Vote](https://vote.uwcs.co.uk). This will be open from the end of the AGM until 12pm on Sun 2nd March. Quorum is 35, so that many people need to vote on each position's election for it to count.

### Shared Office

Introduced in the 2022 AGM and updated in the 2023 AGM, Shared office is a clause in the constitution which reads as follows:

**6.3** Shared Office \
**6.3.1** All positions will be filled up to a maximum of 2 for all available positions, with
exception of the ‘President’ role which has sole occupancy as well as Academic and Gaming
coordinators which can have up to 3. Additional positions should be filled in accordance with
6.3.2 \
**6.3.2** Further officers shall be selected by taking subsequent positions in the STV process,
until the required number of officers is reached. \
**6.3.2.a** This selection cannot pass a vote to Re-Open Nominations. \
**6.3.3** Should a position not reach it’s quota as defined in 6.3.1, the incoming exec should treat
the empty position as a vacant slot in accordance with Warwick SU’s regulation 9 on vacant
slots. \
**6.3.4** If multiple members run together, they will be considered as 1 candidate in regards to
shared office and as such each member will be considered 1/nth of a full vote where n is the
number of people running jointly.
	
In other words: the top 2 candidates will be taken for all positions, with the exception of president (1 candidate) and gaming/academic (3 candidates).

### I WANT TO STAND

Send an email to [**president@uwcs.co.uk**](mailto:president@uwcs.co.uk) with the subject line "UWCS Elections" and the following information:

- Your student ID
- The position(s) you're standing for
- Whether you'll be there in-person or online
- Description (optional, max 100 words, per position)

Or send the same information to the President on discord (username: `alimmeek` and appears as `Alia`).

### On the day

Each position will be discussed in turn:

1. A final call will be made for candidates to stand, before closing nominations for that position.
2. All candidates will have the opportunity to give a 1-2 minute speech, without any other candidate in the room. You can say what you'd like, but we'd recommend talking about why you'd be a good fit for the position, and what you'd like to do. Slides are allowed, but aren't really necessary.
3. We will then open the floor to a Q&A. At first, the questions should not be targeted at any particular candidate, so all candidates can answer in turn. We estimate the Q&A for most positions to take around 5 minutes, but obviously the ones with more people are going to take longer.

# Motions

**Constitutionally changing motions can be submitted until Weds 19 February**, and any other motions right up until the AGM (but please send them in good time so we don't have to look through our emails for them at the meeting).

Send the completed motion documents to `president@uwcs.co.uk` or to the President via discord. Motions require a seconder who is also a member of the society, so you can't just submit them on your own.

[Current Constitution](../UWCS_constitution.pdf)

[Motion Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SvgtgYYuHPoti1gEcyHcsyNtp-4e-lssiEVDRJbfAkE/edit)

### On the day

Each motion will be read out by the returning officer (Alia), and time will be given for members to:

- Ask questions to the proposer/seconder
- Voice support for or opposition to the motion (general discussion of the motion)

### Voting

You can vote to support a motion, vote against a motion, or vote to abstain. If more people vote to support a motion than vote against, and at least 53 people have voted on it, the motion passes.

We'll be using our online voting platform, [UWCS Vote](https://vote.uwcs.co.uk). This will be open from the end of the AGM until 12pm on Sun 2nd March, and results should be announced soon after.
