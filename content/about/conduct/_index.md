Be sure to follow our Code of Conduct on our Discord, on any of our other public platforms, and at our events!
<!-- more -->
Failure to follow our code of conduct in any of our channels or at any of our events can result in expulsion from individual events or the society as a whole. Exec may enforce these rules at their discretion, and their decision is final. If they ask you to stop doing something, please stop doing it.

Generally, if you have concerns about another member's conduct, please contact a Welfare Officer or the President in the first instance, either via our [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.uk), or via [president@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:president@uwcs.co.uk) and [welfare@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:welfare@uwcs.co.uk) respectively. You can find who currently holds these positions [here](@/exec/_index.md).


### 1.  
We aim to be a welcoming society. As such please be friendly to newcomers. If you see someone at an event feeling left out, invite them to join you!

### 2.  
The Society values inclusivity. Do not say anything derogatory or defamatory. This includes, but is not limited to: racist, sexist, homophobic, or transphobic language.

### 3.  
Respect people’s personal space. That extends to taking photos at our events. We will always ask for permission if we want to take any promotional photos, so we ask you do the same.

Please clean up after yourself at our events. Do your part to ensure any venues we host events in are in the same condition at the end of an event as it is at the start.
