Our AGM is on Wednesday, ready for you guys to vote for next years exec and vote for constitutionally changing motions. 

All information about the AGM can be found [here](https://uwcs.co.uk/about/agm/), but the main details are below:

**AGM FORMAT**
1) A review of the year by the exec (annual report)
2) Announcement of exec positions and people standing, Q&A
3) Announcement of motions

**HOW TO STAND**
Email `president@uwcs.co.uk` with your name, student ID, positions you're standing for, and a quick description of why you'd be good in that role (<100 words). You can also stand on the day at the AGM when we are announcing the positions.
At the AGM you will then be invited to talk more about why you'd be good in the role and what you want to do (<2 mins) and there will be a mini Q&A with questions posed to all candidates for that role.
You can stand with a membership bought at any time, even at the AGM!

If you've been a member for at least 2 weeks at the time of the AGM, you'll be able to vote online at https://vote.uwcs.co.uk/ regardless of whether you attend (but we encourage you come for free pizza!)
