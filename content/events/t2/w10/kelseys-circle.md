We are holding a week 10 circle at Kelsey's! The theme for this circle is EMOJI, so come as a recognisable emoji.

The circle will be starting promptly at 19:30 - we recommend getting there around 30 minutes before to get a drink and sit down before we start!

This is also going to be a soft-intro to circling where we'll make it easy to pick up the games at the start, so will hopefully be less intimidating and more fun for people who havent been circling before :)
