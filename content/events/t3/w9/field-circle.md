Why not do it again, this time in a FIELD - after all *one circle is simply not enough*! After all, you gotta touch grass occasionally - and even if you do, there's no guarantee you'll avoid the nuclear punishment bucket if it returns! Even better if you can achieve the TRIPLE crown of *both* circles *and* the Pub Traversal...

For those of you who have **ascended** — we’ve planned an extra one. And in true summer spirit, we’re taking it **outside**. 🌤️

This might be late... but consider this divine intervention — because **we all need to pray for exam success**. 📚🙏

And for the faithful who make it to the end... we’ll be **embarking on a pilgrimage to Smack**.

Please be mindful of others' faith with your outfit, both for those attending the circle and those who may pass by us. If you have any concerns whilst we're there, feel free to find Raven at the circle.
