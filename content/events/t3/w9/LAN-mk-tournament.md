The chance for magic: Delfino Square V2, or perhaps greater! If you have a Switch 2 you'd be willing to lend, we can turn this into a **Mario Kart World** tournament - we only have one Switch 2 at the moment! (preferably a Switch 2 that you haven't hit with a wrench 50 times like JerryRigEverything mind you)
