Are you ready to be part of DCS history? To be part of a **legacy**?? 
Or perhaps you‚Äôre simply ready to beg, steal, borrow or barter for some HOME-BAKED GOODS (made by Irene and Crystal! we promise not to poison you!)

Join us in making a beautiful cover of *‚ÄúAlexander Hamilton‚Äù* about CS Students!
Or if you just want the free food (it‚Äôll be really good) we simply ask that you appear in the video (however this might mean forcing you to sing for up to 10 seconds so... at your own risk)

For proof of our previous work in maintaining DCS history check out https://www.youtube.com/@GiddyUpGlitch
For proof of how good the baked goods will be - trust us. i can bake. These may or may not include savoury foods as well (pizza perhaps?????).

Also feel free to bring along baked goods if you want! more food is always better üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è

If you have any questions, or IDEAS, please DM Irene or Crystal on our Discord :))
