AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRCCCCCCCCCHHHHHHHIIIIIIIIIII! The greatest of all game randomisers, with all items scattered across the games, work together to beat as many games as possible - we'll be sending out more info soon, but have a look at [this list of games](https://archipelago.gg/games) and see what games you'd like to see featured! The more we get, the crazier it'll become, so we'd definitely encourage it - and even better is that you don't have to be at LAN in-person to take part for this, so if you've gone home, you can still join in on the madness ~~crash in the mountain tide, you're the fire inside~~ (don't cause any fires pls, in LIB2 or elsewhere - trying not to have a return of ALARM LAN after all!)
