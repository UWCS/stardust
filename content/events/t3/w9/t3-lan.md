LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... CRANK IT UP (Vitalic's Stamina is a banger, I may have it on rn) - well, along as you don't mix up *Jackbox* for Jackie's Box anyway (pls i need to keep *some* sanity).

__You can bring your PCs, consoles, games and more, all is welcome at LAN!__ 

**IMPORTANT: We have a planned schedule of events, and it's not required to bring your own devices to participate in LAN**

If you want to know more about what LAN is, are wondering "where the fuck is LIB2" (good question), or have any other questions, we have a **LAN guide** you can check out over at: https://uwcs.co.uk/about/lan/

Featuring FNG++ Pro Professional Ultimate Deluxe Edition (yes i made that up), free snacks throughout, **free pizza!**, and many banger events, it's gonna be a wild ride!

We'll have extra background activities including Minecraft UHC, RAAAAAAmphi, Board Games (we didn't forget), Milk Midnight, and Just Maybe a surprise cameo...
