LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... CRANK IT UP (Vitalic's Stamina is a banger, I may have it on rn) - well, along as you don't mix up *Jackbox* for Jackie's Box anyway (pls i need to keep *some* sanity). Join us to kick off LAN with an FNG-like banger, and with Jackbox up on the big screens for some EARLY DERANGEMENT - see you there!
