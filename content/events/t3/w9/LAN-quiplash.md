QUIPLASH. Why is it at 5am? Why the fuck not - also it went hard as fuck at daft o'clock in the morning last year. Everyone had lost just a lil bit of sanity ~~if you're chilling in the dark and you're looking through a telescope you'll see me sipping on a soul of a new hope SO BURN IT DOWN~~ (only fire allowed is FLINT AND STEEL in Minecraft...)
