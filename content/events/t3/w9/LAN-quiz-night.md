I mean, come on, Quiz Night is a *staple* of LAN, you didn't seriously think we wouldn't do it right? *Thank God for ABS, 'cause where we are going is anyone's guess* - the playlist *continues* to go hard, but it's true, we are gonna have some banger rounds, some with slightly niche shitposty vibes! It'll be great fun as always, and WHO DOESN'T LOVE FREE PIZZA HMMM... Come along/stay for this absolute highlight, and hey, if you've been working the open day immediately before like me, that pizza gonna taste just that lil bit sweeter ;)
