Unless you've been living under a rock lately, you'll have heard of Balatro - and we're giving it a spin as a tournament at this LAN!
~~pull out the rug from underneath this CANNIBAL... CANNIBAAAAAL~~ (this playlist goes hard af and ngl, it's a good match for the insanity of a lot of Balatro players - silly hours of the morning being in a *trance*, and getting about as close to real gambling as we're allowed)
