Maybe you're gonna a bit eepy, whether you went to sleep like a sane person, or if you stayed the whole night hooked on the movies or playing Balatro ~~WE LIKE TO DANCE BUT THE DEAD GO FASTER~~ (yes, deadmau5)! Either way, the more reasonable hours of Day 2 are here, and we're kicking it off with something that *can* be calm depending on your approach - blast away those blocks to your heart's content!
