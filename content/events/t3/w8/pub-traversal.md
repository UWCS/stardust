🎉  **Congrats everyone**, exams will very soon be **OVER**, and normal life activites can resume!

🍻 The social secs have COOKED an absolute MEGA route:
1️⃣ 5️⃣ PUBS,
👉 [Part 1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3E1n7nooyeFz8xWs5)
👉 [Part 2](https://maps.app.goo.gl/1aFT7nqxch7rTvcXA)
👉 [Part 3](https://maps.app.goo.gl/7Dz3LGGLc13g1Kmq7)

You might ask why its starting at Junction Building, well in a new tradition I've just created we will be collecting as many freshers as possible who would have just finished their last exam. Imagine the army we could assemble 👍 

🏆 **To signify how much of a *SPECIAL ACHIEVEMENT* it will be to finish this route** (and all ***15 PUBS*** therein 🍺🍺🍺...you get the idea) — Rowan will *personally* be buying the **WINNERS** an item of **fast food** 🍗🍟 from the one and only **SPICY BITE** 🔥🌶️.

Rules:
✅ You must have at least 1 alcoholic beverage in each pub 🍻.
❌ If you don't drink...
***YOU LOSE*** 😈.
