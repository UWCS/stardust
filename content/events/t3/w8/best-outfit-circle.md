### You will need a [Circling Ticket](https://tickets.warwicksu.com/ents/event/26767/)

It's that time again  - another **UWCS circle**. This time it's gonna be **even MORE** of a banger. The theme is simple: **Wear your best circle outfit.**

That means that one **circle that you put a bunch of effort into**, we wanna see **that fit**. Maybe you went [**all out at our Smurfs vs Minions** circle](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/archive/2425/t1/w7/circle/), or the [BIG MEAL circle](https://uwcs.co.uk/events/t3/w3/big-meal-circle/), or maybe you had a **certy banger at a circle for another soc** ðŸ¤¨ . If **you thought it went hard**, whip it out for one more ride. ðŸ”‚ 

If all of your fits were rotters or this is your first circle, then your **fall back is wearing a bin bag.** 

There will be a **prize for the most impressive/creative outfit** of the night to reward those of you who **cooked** in your previous circles. ðŸŽ‰ 

As mentioned, we will be** in the Copper Rooms**, which means you'll need a **Circling + Event ticket from the [SU Website](https://tickets.warwicksu.com/ents/event/26767/) for week 8.** Make sure to grab one before they're gone!

__**Then afterwards, we go Pop!**__
