We currently have an empty seat for our Events Officer Role, meaning if you didn't run for a position in the AGM and want to, now's your chance!

The main responsibility of the role will be to plan and manage the ball, so if you enjoyed the ball or think you'd be good at running it, this is the role for you!

We're having a by-election to elect this role at the week 8 FNG! If you want to stand, please send `Your full name`, `Student ID`, `Optional description`, to [president@uwcs.co.uk](mailto:president@uwcs.co.uk) before the nomination period closes. Post any questions in `‚Å†ask-the-exec` on Discord!
