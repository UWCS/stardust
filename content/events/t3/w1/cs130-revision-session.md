As a conclusion to a somewhat hectic week back, UWCS once again brings you a CS130 revision session! From basic theorems all the way up to partial orders, countability and more, come join us for a late night shift in MS.01, and hopefully come away being ever more confident of conquering the beast known as *Mathematics for Computer Scientists 1*!
