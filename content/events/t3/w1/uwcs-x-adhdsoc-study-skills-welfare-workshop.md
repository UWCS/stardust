We're bringing you a nice shiny collab with ADHDsoc as we enter exam season to give helpful ideas on how to revise and managing your wellbeing during a difficult time. Whilst this is a collab with ADHDsoc, all society members are welcome, however there are quite a lot of neurodivergent people within both societies, so we wanted to deliver this in a way that fits everybody the best we can! ~~After all, what are we doing with HD in the name if we're not delivering high-quality sessions.~~

Come join us in OC1.04 as we attempt to build you up into the exam answering *machines* that'll get you those sweet grades come the end of the year - and who knows, maybe you'll be set up more mentally for the geese and velociraptor fights to come!
