Third-year project presentations are back ðŸŽ‰
This is your chance as a third-year student to showcase your dissertation project to inspire the second years who will be picking topics for their projects soon, and celebrate the incredible amounts of work you've all put in. You're welcome to present in any style you like: slides, talks, live demos, or even something more creative!

If youâ€™re interested in presenting, DM Edward ( `@Edward Oâ€™D` ) or email `academic@uwcs.co.uk`.
