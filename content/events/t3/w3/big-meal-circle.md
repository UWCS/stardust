# **:rotating_light: EMERGENCY: IT'S CIRCLE TIME! :rotating_light:**

This term, UWCS is bringing you **TWO CIRCLES** alongside a lineup of *epic* socials - more details coming soon... *trust me*. 

## **THEME: BIG MEAL**

**What does "Big Meal" mean?**\
Great question. The *true* meaning has been lost to time... but that just means you guys get to take the risk of **figuring it out!**  

Come dressed as **anything** you'd find in, on, or around a **BIG MEAL** - whether that's a **:hamburger: burger**, a **:hotdog: hotdog**, a **dining table**, or even a **:salt: salt shaker**. The wilder, the better! 

We'll be heading to **POP** after Kelsey's, so grab your tickets now:\

Oh and as always the good old trusty bucket will be there :grin: 
Good luck with the rest of April exams guys :thumbsup:
