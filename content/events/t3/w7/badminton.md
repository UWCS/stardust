[//]: # (R: I have a fix locally for the timing stuff but have not set it up yet so staying as 11:59am for now)

Exam revision weighing you down? Want to celebrate an early finish? Come along to the Westwood Games Hall on Kirby Corner Rd for an hour of chill badminton. Not to be confused with bad mints, they may give variable results in freshness of breath.
