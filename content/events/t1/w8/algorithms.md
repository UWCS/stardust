Second years have their CS260 Algorithms exam on *Monday* at **5pm**. We know this, we know you are worried and stressed.

So, we have decided to host a revision session just two days prior to help you prepare for the exam!

We will have our academic officers (big thank you to them) preparing a bit of a revision session for anyone planning to attend, so you will hopefully feel prepared for the exam. Any questions can be answered on the day :)
