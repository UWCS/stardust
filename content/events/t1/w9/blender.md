We hear all the CS324 students crying, we know the pain you are going through.

Don't you worry! We are working alongside *Warwick Game Design* and *Warwick Content Creation Society* to offer you a quick session on how to get into **Blender** (the answer for basically your entire coursework).

This workshop will start from an introduction to 3D modelling all the way to advanced techniques so you can impress Shan will all of your snazzy skills! :)
