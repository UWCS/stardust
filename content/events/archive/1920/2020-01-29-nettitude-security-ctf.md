Nettitude are coming to the department on **Wednesday 29th January (Week 4)** to run a CTF (Capture the Flag) Security competition in **CS0.03** from **2pm â€“ 6pm**\! It will be a series of challenges designed to test your skills in Computer Security, breaking into and finding weaknesses in a system they have designed.

Anyone that wishes to take part should bring their laptop with a copy of a Kali Linux and some VM software. During the event we'll also be providing free pizza (it's great brain-food\!).

We'd appreciate it if you could express interest on the Facebook event so we know how many people to expect\!
