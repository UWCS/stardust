*G-Research is a leading quantitative research and technology company.  By using the latest scientific techniques, we produce world-beating predictive research and build advanced technology to analyse the world’s data.*

-----

Join us for the G-Research Coding Challenge where you will compete in teams in a series of progressively difficult challenges. You will be competing in teams of 2-3 to build a natural language calculation engine (no prior NLP experience required). The challenges will cover things like evaluation of arithmetic expressions to unit conversions and equation solving.

We will allocate teams when you arrive, you don't need to find a team beforehand - but feel free to bring your own team if you would like. To take part, you will need to bring at least one laptop per team. This laptop should be prepared for the challenge (e.g. have Visual Studio loaded if using C\# or equivalent for Java/Python)

There will be a live leader board up on the projector to give all teams the opportunity to see where they are placing throughout the challenge. 1st and, 2nd place (decided by a point system) will win prizes\!

Following the event we will provide drinks and canapés and a chance for you to informally talk with our employees about internships, graduate roles and life at G-Research.

Languages for the challenges - .NET Core 2 , Java and Maven or Python 3 with client starter kits provided when you login.

To register for this coding challenge, please email <graduates@gresearch.co.uk> detailing whether you are registering as an individual or a team.
