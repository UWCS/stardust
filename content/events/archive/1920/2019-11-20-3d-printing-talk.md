For this week's Computing Society talk, Alex Dixon will be talking about 3D printing\! The talk will be in L5 on Wednesday the 20th of November, from 1-2pm.  

3D printing is an increasingly commonplace technology, allowing people with any level of technical skill to make trinkets, mechanical parts, geese, figurines, and figurines of geese. Alex's talk will explain the basics of 3D printing, from creating or finding designs to print, the software involved with preparing models for print, and the printing process itself. The Computing Society has a 3D printer which is free to use for members, and we'll let let you know how you can go about getting things printed on it.  

Alex is a PhD student in Computer Science, former exec of the Computing Society, and the CTO of Pocket Workshop, a company that 3D prints miniatures for tabletop games.  

The Computing Society will be providing free pizza for the talk, so to give us an idea of numbers, please tell us you're going on FB: <https://www.facebook.com/events/727661954414266/> or let an exec know\!
