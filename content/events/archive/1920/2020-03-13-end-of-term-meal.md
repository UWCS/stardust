We're going to be having our end of term meal at the Farmhouse.  
[https://www.thefarmhouserestaurant.co.uk/](https://www.thefarmhouserestaurant.co.uk/?fbclid=IwAR27umj3fba1uvqSLUvtPbX6bwGjj8N0FDAKjulXkCRpslok_81n5fESWlA) as per tradition.  
The meal will take place on the last Friday of term before gaming.  
You can meet us outside the DCS at about 18:00 to walk over or meet us there around about half past.  
Please register if you're going on Facebook so we have an idea of how many people will be coming along\!
