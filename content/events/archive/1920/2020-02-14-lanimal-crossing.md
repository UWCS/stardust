It's time for another LAN party\!  

Our LANs are bi-termly events where we take our computers to LIB2 and play games for the weekend. For more information about what LAN parties are and what to bring to them, visit our [help page](https://uwcs.co.uk/about/lan-information/).

Signups will be through our LAN service [warwick.gg](http://warwick.gg/) and will open in due course\!
