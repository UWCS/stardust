We'll be running our first set of Lightning talks by our members both past and present\! It'll be live in the voice chats on [Discord](http://discord.gg/uwcs) and we'll aim to record them and upload on YouTube afterwards if you can't come along on the evening.

We'll have three talks this time:

  - Rewriting binary logs because your database broke (Sinjo)
  - 7 niche git features in 14 minutes (Sam)
  - Functional programming karaoke (dixonary)
