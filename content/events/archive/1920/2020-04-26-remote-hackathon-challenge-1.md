**Update: We have extended the deadline to midnight on Sunday 10th May due to new information about the prizes.**

This will be the first in a series of remote hackathons each lasting a week with a theme to develop a piece of software in\! You can take part either individually or as a team, and **there are prizes available for the best submissions** (see below for details\!)

## **Theme: Community**

The communities we are in are more important now than ever, so we think it would be great to see if you can develop some sort of application (probably web\!) that provides some sort of community value.

Everyones in many different communities, from your friends and family, sports clubs, societies, local area, along with many more\! Because of this we don’t want to be too prescriptive of what exactly you might want to make, as it’ll be different for all of you.

We know it’s quite a broad theme however so we have some ideas if you need help getting started:

  - Recreate a physical game to work in a web browser (for example how Pretend You’re Xyzzy cloned Cards against Humanity)
  - A scoring/competition system for your sports club or society to use next year
  - A messenger app with some novel addition
  - A tool to help your local area keep in contact or request help if they need it

There’ll be lots of technical things to think about especially if its web based (which we imagine most will be to tie into the community theme\!), including your choice of language, security constraints, syncing data in real-time, etc\!

Good luck and we can’t wait to see what you come up with.
