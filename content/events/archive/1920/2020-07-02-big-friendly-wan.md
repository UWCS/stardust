Due to current ongoing events, we won't be able to run our end of year LAN in person this year, instead we're making it into a WAN\! There'll be no signups so just come and chat to us on [Discord](http://discord.gg/uwcs) and see what everyone's playing and get involved\!

You can find our schedule down below with some of the activities we have planned, but there'll be plenty of time around these to play whatever you like\!
