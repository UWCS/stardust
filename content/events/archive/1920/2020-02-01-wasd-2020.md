Started in 2016, WASD (Warwick's Awesome Speedruns and Demos) is a 2-day speedrunning event run annually at the University of Warwick. It is the largest student-run speedrunning event in the UK. Past events have featured a diverse range of games, from Final Fantasy IX to Rise of the Tomb Raider, from Super Monkey Ball to Parasite Eve II.

Donations to the event are in support of [SpecialEffect](https://specialeffect.org.uk/), a wonderful UK-based charity whose mission is to put fun and inclusion back into the lives of people with physical disabilities, by helping them to play video games. They do this by using and developing a range of accessibility hardware and software, from modified joypads to eye-gaze technology.
