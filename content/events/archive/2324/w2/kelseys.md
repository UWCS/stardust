We are hosting our *first* circling event of the year! Don't forget that the theme is to dress up as something that matches the first letter of your name.

Make sure you follow the theme and don't be late, we have no mercy here >:)

*if you are a fresher or on campus, you can meet us at university interchange at ~6:10pm and we will take the bus over together!*
