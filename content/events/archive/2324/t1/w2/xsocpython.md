Come to a beginner-friendly course, in collaboration with Warwick AI and Code Soc. There will be an opportunity to learn some valuable coding skills that companies would love to see!

We completed the first week, so this is a continuation of some of the skills you started last week. All labs and documents can be found at go.uwcs.co.uk/python
