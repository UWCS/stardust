Yes indeed. It is December. We have reached the final month of the year, and the final few weeks of the term. 

**HOWEVER,** we are computer science/DCS/STEM/whatever the heck you are students, and so we will do Advent of Code this year!

Choose your favorite programming language and jump into some fun challenges this month to test your knowledge and approaches to various questions :)

We are hosting this event for the *first* programming challenge of the month.
