Interested in the idea of working for a trading firm? Or looking to make some coin 🪙 ?

**Da Vinci Derivatives** is specifically looking for *3rd year (and beyond) Computer Science students* to attend and participate in their upcoming on-campus event!

**Recruiter** *Margherita Cantele* and **Quant Researcher** *Nick Timmer* will discuss how Da Vinci tackles market inefficiencies, whilst running through cases directly with students, allowing for a glimpse into what opportunities you might have at such a firm.

Don't miss out on this great opportunity (*which may also have free pizza! 🍕*)
