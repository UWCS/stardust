In UWCS, we welcome everyone and we encourage you to feel comfortable in your own skin! With this mindset, we will be attending our first **Loud and Proud** of the year. 

If you'd like to celebrate inclusivity, banging tunes, and forget that we are more than a quarter into the term, then join us at *Tbar* before heading into *Copper Rooms* for Loud and Proud!

To attend Loud & Proud, you will need to purchase tickets from https://tickets.warwicksu.com/ents/event/24380/
