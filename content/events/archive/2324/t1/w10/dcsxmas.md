TAKE A BREAK FROM COURSEWORK!! 

Come grab some free mince pies and alcohol (and even pizza later) at the annual DCS Xmas Social!

UWCS will be helping set up some games, and we will be hosting a series of talks, including a karaoke talk by the infamous James Archbold! *You don't want to miss this*

We will also be hosting a quiz, as you can expect the amazing rounds as per usual so you should definitely come and check it out :)
