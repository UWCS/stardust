𝙒𝙚 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙜𝙤𝙞𝙣𝙜 𝙩𝙤 𝘽𝙞𝙧𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙝𝙖𝙢 𝘾𝙝𝙧𝙞𝙨𝙩𝙢𝙖𝙨 𝙈𝙖𝙧𝙠𝙚𝙩! ✨ 

You all probably need a bit of a break from everything, so why don't you come and enjoy the Christmas market in Birmingham with us!

We will be meeting at *University Interchange* at **2pm** ⇒ taking the **2:09pm** 12X to *Coventry Station* ⇒ taking the **2:36pm** Avanti West Coast train to *Birmingham New Street*.

Also, this is a **sober social**! While you can buy alcohol at the market, we would like to keep it sober on the day.

Hope to see you there :)
