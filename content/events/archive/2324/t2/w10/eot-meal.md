Damn, is it already âŒš time for another end of term meal?? Where did the term go???? (no really, where, I have so many courseworks to submit and haven't even started thinking about exams lmaooo but we move)!

Well done on getting through the last teaching term of this academic year, we're nearly there and I can smell the sweet summer flowers ðŸ’®  !  Why don't you come on down to our BRAND NEW RESTAURANT CHOICE and celebrate the end of another term???

If you'd like to come along, please fill in the form so we can gauge engagement for the event and let the restaurant know how many people to accommodate for! Please note that although we will have a range of vegetarian options, there are limited vegan options <3
