Problem: but it works on my machine? Solution: Docker. We're gonna to teach you how to use it (along with a side of GitHib actions, Portainer, and Flask). There will be a short (30 min) presentation followed by a lab session where you will get to host your own website.

For any 1st years attending this will count to your PDP; 2nd years this might be useful for your 261 project

Pre-requisites: basic knowledge of GitHub
