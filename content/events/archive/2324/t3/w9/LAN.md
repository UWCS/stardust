Exams may be hitting us left right and centre at the moment, but don't forget we're only less than a month away from freedom. No more exams, no more coursework... bliss.

So, it only makes sense that we all go out with a bang! This Term's LAN will be held in our usual venue and will be jam-packed with all sorts of fun events. not least because we're making up for the fact we didn't have a LAN last term :wah~1:

For those unaware, LAN is an event we host once a term where gamers unite and play for 48 hours straight (okay, you don't have to play video games for a full 48 hours if you don't want to, that would be insane). To get caught up to speed about LAN, check out our new guidance page, which should answer most, if not all of your questions!

This LAN will also see the return of the @/LANLubbers role! You can add or remove this role at any time, and with it on, you'll receive reminders for all the events we're running. You'll still get daily schedules with the Gaming role.
