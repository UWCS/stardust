We have a final UWCS circle lined up! This one will be in a FIELD, so don't forget POP tickets! It is our social sec's inaugural circle so expect it to be the best you've ever attended. The theme will be announced later - we don't want to spoil you ðŸ¤«
Since it's a Field circle, it will be BRING YOUR OWN DRINKS, and bring what you plan to drink
