We are kicking off the UWCS end of term socials with a bang, with the first and last BBQ of the year! Congratulations to everyone who's finished exams, now here's your reward (the best jokes of all time): :scream::scream: :scream:

1. Lets all **meat** up :nerd:
2. We got the **grill**, you bring the **thrill** :smile:
3. **Steaks** are high and so is the fun, don't miss out :hotdog:

~~Bad~~ Excellent jokes aside, there will be loads of free food, so there is actually no reason not to come. This will be held in the Claycroft BBQ area, found at this link:
