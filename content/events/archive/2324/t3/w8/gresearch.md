G-Research are doing a talk! Join us next Wednesday as they will explain their background, AI research and their outreach & recruitment grants programs.
As well as this, they will be hosting an interactive game, where the top 3 scores will win a Â£100 AMAZON VOUCHER each!
This session is aimed for students curious about quant finance* and/or internship opportunities, so if this sounds like you we will see you there!
