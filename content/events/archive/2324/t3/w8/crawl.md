After the resounding success of the BBQ where you *very hungry people* consumed **80 burgers AND 80 hot-dogs** :scream::scream::scream: I've been given permission to run yet another Pub Traversal, this time in **Leamington Spa** (so RIP your wallets :money_with_wings: :money_with_wings: :money_with_wings:) and on a Sunday so you can cure your hangover from Skool Dayz with yet more alcohol. As a result we have prepared:

### The Ultimate ***Route***

Starting at 4:00pm in the Dirty Duck followed by the 4:40 bus into Leamington where we have **8** pubs lined up, as it is a Sunday we are going to have to speed run the hell out of this and finish before the pubs all shut at 11pm, so it certainly will be a mental turn of events. Rest assured that you will not be disappointed with the ***route*** and that means you have no:

### Excuses :minibus: :minibus: :minibus:

Nick's impressive line: you have no excuse to ditch like your tinder date ditched you.

**TLDR**: It's gonna be awesome, you got sweet FA to do on a Sunday so why not?
