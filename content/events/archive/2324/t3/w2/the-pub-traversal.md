We are back with a vengeance this term with a pub traversal like no other! One, two, or even three pubs? **FAT CHANCE** - we're gonna hit **7 😱** because why settle for anything less? 🤔🤔🤔

Join the **CHAOS** at the Bus Interchange at 7pm sharp, as we embark on our heroic voyage: starting at the Oak Inn and finishing at spoons, Coventry won't know what hit 'em. Get ready for a night so unbelievably good you'll be questioning if you've dropped dead already 🫠

Whether you do not do this very often, or a seasoned regular, prepare for this to be certainly one of the events of the year. Do not miss out!
