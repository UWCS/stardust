The end of term is fast approaching, and DCS have organised a Term 2 social.

From 2pm you will have access to the Esports machines and consoles, including the racing simulator! **On arrival you will be given a Fusion voucher (Â£10) to buy food and drink.**

Also, from 4pm we'll be hosting a quiz with some fun prizes, so make sure to stick around for that!

See you there :)
