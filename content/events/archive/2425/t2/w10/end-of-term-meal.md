We are going to **SHIN Japanese Kitchen & Bar**, and will consume an inconceivable amount of food which may actually be slightly healthy for once because it's **East Asian cuisine**!ðŸ˜±

Check out their menu [here](https://deliveroo.co.uk/menu/coventry/coventry-city-centre/shin-ramen)!

Interested in coming? Fill out [this interest form](https://forms.gle/MpU36Cjs2KqBiRUh8)

**If you want a 10% DISCOUNT** (which let's be honest who doesn't) **MAKE SURE TO BRING CASH** since they give a discount on cash (*there is an ATM just by the restaurant*).

The bus times will be sent out closer to the day, but ***we are wanting to get there and sat down for 7:15pm***, so you have been warned.
