Warwick University Real Ale Festival is the largest student-run beer festival in Europe. With over 100 beers, 50+ ciders, a variety of wines and mead, plus live entertainment and food (with vegan options), it promises to be a great night!

We'll be meeting at DCS around 6pm and walking down at around 6.15pm. Also, Real Ale have said that we'll get a bonus Â£30 of free drinks if we can get a group of 10 to go. To qualify for this please fill in the form on discord.

More info can be found on Real Ale's instagram ~~or on any of the hundreds of posters around campus~~
