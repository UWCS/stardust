Hi chat, this is a definitely not super late announcement for the procedural generation talk/workshop! 

We're going to investigate the perlin noise algorithm and see how we can apply it to procedurally generate textures and terrain (pictured below).

The format is a talk (~40 mins) followed by a workshop.

Note to 1st years: you can get PDP points and these will be handed out just before 6, as we recognise there is a cs141 lecture then
