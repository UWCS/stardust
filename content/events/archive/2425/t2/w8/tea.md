UWCS' Welfare Officer Raven is officially bringing you: *Tea++*, with free drinks\* at Curiositea!

**How will this work?**

We will have 4 of the best tables in Curiositea booked for 2 hours, from 1pm-3pm. This will be a **drop-in event**, however ~~due to not wanting to bankrupt the society~~ there will be **25** £4 off tokens available, so it's best to come early to snag the free drink!

Other than that, come relax with us, chat about the AGM (yes, same day!), how coursework is going (or not going), how life is going, or heck, maybe you can help me start another insane ramble about Goliath Birdeaters again!

\* Disclaimer: *You can buy e.g. special drinks with these tokens as well, **but** be aware if it goes above £4 you will have to pay the difference* (still, 30p for one of my favourite drinks is a damn sweet deal!)
