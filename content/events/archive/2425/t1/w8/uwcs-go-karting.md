## Yes, it is time. Time for you to finally experience what makes our society absolutely theÂ greatest...

# GO KARTING

Right this is it everyone, the biggest, the craziest, the most unbelievable social you will ever experience; for the first time in com soc history we are going karting so strap on your seatbelts and try not to immediately crash and burn because somehow they are letting comp sci students behind a wheel.

THE SOCIAL SECS have block booked the whole of TeamSport Coventry out so we have 2 hours of carnage all to ourselves. You can either meet us directly at the track at 17:40pm or at the bus interchange at 17:00 where we plan on catching the 14 bus together.
