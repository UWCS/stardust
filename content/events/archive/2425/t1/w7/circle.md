# It is time once again... time for CIRCLE!!

After the **outraging success** that was the Week 2 circle, **we are back** to grace Warwick with the **best circles** to ever exist. And this time we are not **holding back** 😱

The Circle is happening in the **[SU Atrium](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c885f421e6f5928c0c7d1?projectId=warwick)** again, so make sure to buy your **["Circling & Event" tickets!!!](https://tickets.warwicksu.com/ents/event/25645/)** Be there for **7pm SHARP**, otherwise `[REDACTED]` may happen 😱. And make sure to buy them **early** to prevent disappointment like last time!

If you are on the fence of coming, *which shouldn't be a question*, 🤔 I have personally written a message to all years: 📝
- Freshers: you have no excuse
- 2nd years: while we may be cooked with seg faults in C and Postgres being a bitch, we all deserve a break
- 3rd years: while you may be shafted by your project, have some fun!
- 4th years & post grads: you delayed getting a job by at least a year, might as well delay your work for a day

Since people have had the opportunity to *experience* circling, we are bringing back the *one*, the *only*, **NUCLEAR PUNISHMENT bucket** 😱 ❗ If you have not been graced by the mere presence of this holy bucket, **you are in for a treat!!**

# Now for the all important theme: **__Minions vs Smurfs__** 🍌 🔵 

Want to be screaming **BONANA** at the top of your voice whilst "stealing the moon" with Gru? 🌚 Or do you want to reign supreme and be blue, cause if you were green you would die?
No matter what faction you choose to be a part of, you better not be **BORING**! 😠 

Purple will be drank, voices will be broken, and the circle will **always** be in session.

**Note:** Please don't pre-drink the circle, and make sure to eat beforehand. Let exec know if you feel unwell.
