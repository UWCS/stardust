**UWCS** and **MathsSoc** are collabing to bring you the ✨LaTeX✨ workshop! Learn how to harness the power of LaTeX to typeset your documents and write beautiful problem sheets, amazing reports, and more. 

This session will particularly help for those who have no experience with programming, but feel free to come along if you're already using LaTeX and want to ask for more advanced LaTeX help.
