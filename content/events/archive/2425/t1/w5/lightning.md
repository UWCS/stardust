A lightning talk is a short (15-20min) presentation given by anyone on any topic they like. It's a great way to share something you're passionate about with the rest of the society. If you're interested in giving a talk, please let us know on our discord. If you're interested in attending, just show up on the day!

We've also combined it with comp cafe so free snacks and drinks will be provided!
