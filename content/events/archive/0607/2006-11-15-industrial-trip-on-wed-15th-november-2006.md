We're off to see Hursley, one of IBM's biggest software development laboratories on the 15th of November (Wednesday). We've got a coach booked to leave from campus by 1220 (sharp) and depart from Hursley at 5pm (trip time is around two hours). You don't need to be a member to come along, non-members should email their names and university numbers to exec@uwcs.co.uk. Cost: &Â£4 per head. Loading 1200 to 1215 for 1220 departure.
