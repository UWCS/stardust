Windows Vista presents HCI opportunities as never before from the new AERO interface paradigm, to the new .NET programming model, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). In this session [Mike Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/) will examine both AERO and WPF and look at how developers and designers can create amazing user interfaces. The talk will last approximately 90 minutes.

We have also got some goodies to give away\!
