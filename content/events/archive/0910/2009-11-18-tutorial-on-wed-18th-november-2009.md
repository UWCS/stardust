The talk will be given by our academic president, Connor. Topics are likely to include an overview of the language itself, prototype based design and asynchronous I/O.

Connor is a JavaScript enthusiast, so whatever level of interest you have, it'll be worth coming to see a more mature perspective on the topic, and of course ask questions\!
