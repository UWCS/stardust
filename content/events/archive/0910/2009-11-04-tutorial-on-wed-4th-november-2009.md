First will be a (reasonably) brief talk introducing Python to give you a flavour of the language. This should be accessible to everyone but it might be a bit quick for those who have not done any programming at all. My original intent was not to make it as an introduction to programming in general, but afterwards there should be some material to help you get started, and there will certainly be lots of people interested in programming to talk to\!

Afterwards we will be heading to DCS where you can have a go at one of the sheets I've prepared on various topics concerning Python. I will be happy to try and answer any questions\!

If you aren't sure where S0.10 is, there will be a group of people leaving for there at 1750 from the DCS building.
