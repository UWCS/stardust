Come join the society in the annual Real Ale Festival. There is a huge choice of drinks to be had and a full list of these is to be found at http://tinyurl.com/ylpdy2e . There will be live music from Dr Busker who are a fantastic band playing all sorts of bizarre songs including panda wanker and a unique rendition of Postman Pat. I highly recommend attending if you haven't been before its a great time for 2.50 entry even if you aren't planning on drinking. Can you drink more than Mogmiester and Zaer did last year? :)
