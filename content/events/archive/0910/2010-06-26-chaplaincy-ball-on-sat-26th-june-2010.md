The Chaplaincy Charity Ball will be taking place on Saturday 26th June (at the end of week 9) at 8pm in the Chaplaincy. The theme will be 'prehistoric', and the entire Chaplaincy will be decorated as such. The dress code is fancy dress or "formal", though this is not enforced in any way. There will be a live band, followed by a disco, finishing at 2am.

The ticket price is £30, with a reduction to £25 for people buying through CompSoc. This ticket price includes all food and drink for the evening. We install a bar in the library area of the Chaplaincy, which serves both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, including two real ales on tap.
