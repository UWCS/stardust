The internet has completely revolutionised the distribution of music, films, books and information. However, copyright law has failed to keep up with modern times.

Did you know that its illegal to rip music from CDs to your computer or MP3 player?\* Chances are that, under current law, you are a criminal.

Andrew Robinson will come to argue the case for abolition of copyright law entirely. Not only should ripping be made legal, but Bittorrenting, downloading and CD-sharing should be possible under his plans. The Pirate Party will also argue that drug patents should be done away with.

If you want to learn more then feel free to come along. The talk and Q\&A will last for around an hour and a half and be followed by a social at the pub.
