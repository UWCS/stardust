Warwick Internet Entrepreneurs is a sub-group of Warwick Entrepreneurs society. Our ultimate goal is to build a startup hub centred at the University of Warwick. We believe that Warwick has potential; with the right mix of researchers, potential investors, and most importantly, talented young developers and entrepreneurs.

Weekly meeting to work on projects, discuss ideas and meet with others interested in the potential of the web.
