ok i'm pretty sure everyone knows the awesomeness of alton towers- so lets go\! afaik there hasnt been a trip for a while, and around halloween they put on a pretty spiffy show\!

If you are interested, please sign up ASAP so we can have an idea of numbers. more people, less monies\!\! :)

it will be between £20 to £30 per person which includes coach there and back from the university of warwick. we would be leaving uni at 8amish and leaving alton towers at 7pmish. it's an amazing deal, so please dont miss out and sign up\!\! :D

IF YOU WILL NOT BE GETTING THE COACH WITH EVERYONE ELSE FROM CAMPUS, PLEASE SAY IN YOUR SIGNUP\! this means that you will be making your own way there and back, as well as buying your own ticket\!\!
