With the current Left4Dead 2 preorder prices on Steam, it is significantly cheaper to buy the game as a group of four, rather than individually. To facilitate everyone being able to get into this orgy as they wish, add your name here\! If there isn't an exact multiple of four by the end of preorders, we'll probably have to resort to first-come-first-served.

At the moment, a single copy costs £27, whereas a foursome is £80.99 (£20.25 each).

It could be useful if you include a SteamID in the description, especially if you aren't a member of the Steam community (and why aren't you\!?)

There will be an order going out on OCTOBER 25 for the first 4n signups at this date, in order that all preorders can get full access to the demo. After this date, orders will hopefully go out as 4somes are formed.

EVENT LIMITED TO FIFTEEN AS THESE WILL ALL HAVE THEIR GAME BEFORE DEMO RELEASE.

PLEASE CONTINUE TO SIGNUP: reserve list will have orders processed as soon as four people sign up.
