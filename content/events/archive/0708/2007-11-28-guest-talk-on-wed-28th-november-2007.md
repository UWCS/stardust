# IBM Guest Lecture: Virtualise Everything and Save the Planet\!

IT resource 'sprawl' is everywhere, servers are procured for separate  
projects and under-utilised, the end effect is an environment that  
consumes administration time, much 'wattage' and generates a lot of hot  
air\! The industry response is a call to 'consolidation', that is, to  
gather many 'small' workloads into larger servers, increasing  
utilisation and thus improving cost-efficiency, all in all a good  
approach but this requires excellent negotiating skills to arrange  
maintenance 'windows' with seventy different users -a difficult task at the best of times-  
however, near-zero downtime systems such as the 'mainframe' can help  
remove this problem, but within the 'UNIX' and Linux world, this was a  
difficult problem to resolve. This lecture discusses the technologies  
taken from the mainframe environment that allow UNIX servers to support  
the operations required for large scale consolidation to reduce server  
sprawl, power costs, etc by providing the ability to move running  
workloads between separate physical servers without any 'service'  
interruption.The discussion covers the technologies required for this  
capability and their operation, including: The POWER hypervisor  
virtualisation layer, virtual processors, virtual I/O (network and  
disk), live partition mobility, application mobility and operating  
system requirements.

The presenter is Peter Nutt, who joined IBM in 2000 and is based in the  
UK. Peter primarily works on AIX systems and is a member of the STG  
implementation team, he has expertise in the fields of virtualisation,  
performance analysis, Oracle solutions and implementation. Peter has  
co-authored three IBM Redbooks: 'Live Partition Mobility', 'Porting to  
AIX 5L', 'A Practical Guide to RMC' and regularly presents at the EMEA  
and Americas IBM Technical University conferences.
