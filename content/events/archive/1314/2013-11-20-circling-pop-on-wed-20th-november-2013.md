Warwick Computing Society will be circling at the Terrace Bar in the SU and then head off to Pop for a great mid-week mayhem\! There will be a theme and everyone will have to adhere to the theme or face punishment.  
For those who hasn't been to circling or pop: Circling is an event in which we play drinking games and consume Purple (AKA Snakebite).  
Pop is an event at the Copper Rooms, SU.

Just be there\!
