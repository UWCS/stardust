We have a guest talk from the BBC entitled: "BBC iPlayer in The Cloud (Video Factory on Tour)"

Abstract:  
"BBC iPlayer is one of the biggest video on-demand platforms. iPlayer has over 6 million users every month and supports thousands of devices including interactive TVs, Set-top-boxes, phones, tablets and PCs. The BBC pushes over 500 hours of new content to iPlayer every week.

Over the past 12 months, the BBC has completely rebuilt the backend of iPlayer, migrating the ingest, transcode & delivery workflow onto the Cloud. This project was known as “Video Factory”.

As part of the BBC’s remit to inform, educate and entertain, we want to share our experiences and what we’ve learned throughout this project. We will be touring several Universities throughout the country over the next few months, and hope that you’d be interested in accommodating us.

We’d like to give a presentation lasting about an hour including a demonstration (network connectivity permitting)."

There'll be free pizza at the talk\!
