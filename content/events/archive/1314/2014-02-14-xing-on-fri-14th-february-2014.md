Provisionally in the same room as Friday night gaming at the moment, one of the labs in downstairs DCS. Knock on the window to get in.

XING is intended as a nice environment for programming or whatever, and sometimes we will try to work on something together. It is open to people of all backgrounds and abilities. If you are interested in learning to program or want to get help with something we're always willing to help (be it by starting you off or directing you to the tools you need to get on with it).
