We're doing a trip to the [National Museum of Computing](http://www.tnmoc.org/) in Bletchley. We shall be taking one of their 2 hour guided tours.

We will be leaving at 1:15pm from outside Costcutter on campus, we have arranged transport.

Entry fee is Â£10, you should pay veltas on the day before getting on the coach. You will not be allowed on the coach without paying.

We should arrive back around 6:30pm, you may wish to bring some dinner for the ride back on the coach (if the driver doesn't mind us eating).

Feel free to ask [veltas](mailto:academic-president@uwcs.co.uk) any questions.

Hope to see you there\!

Signups are for an idea of numbers, as ever: all that is required to go is to bring the cash before or on the day.
