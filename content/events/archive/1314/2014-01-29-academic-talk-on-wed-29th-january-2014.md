Flask is a python microframework designed to make it easier than ever to design, prototype and build web applications with little overheads. This talk will cover creating application logic, integrating with a database via sqlalchemy, and security issues that one should be aware of.

Signups are, as ever, for an indication of numbers and not required for attendance.
