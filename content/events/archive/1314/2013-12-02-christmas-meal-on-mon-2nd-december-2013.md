Christmas meal at [Wing Wah](http://www.wingwah.net/branch/coventry/), a Chinese Buffet restaurant. We have our own private room along with a fabulous Chinese karaoke machine\!

The secret santa gifts will be given out at the meal too.

The meal costs Â£11.99 per person (drinks extra).

We'll be meeting outside DCS at 6:30 to walk together to the restaurant in Coventry. It's about a 40 minute walk.

The Christmas meal will be replacing the weekly pub social week 10 Monday.

If you like dress up nice\!
