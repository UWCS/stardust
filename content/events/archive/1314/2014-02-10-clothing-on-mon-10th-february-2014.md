\*I am accepting orders now, order before the event expires at the end of this LAN: this is the deadline.\*

If you would like CompSoc-themed clothing talk to veltas who will be at pubs and gaming during the offer, or can be contacted by [email](malto:academic-president@uwcs.co.uk) or on [IRC](http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/services/irc/) (IRC preferably).

The clothing will be the same as the last order from over a year ago, so if you would like an example just stare at anyone who has it.

The options are:  
\* T-shirt £5.95  
\* Hoodies £12.95  
\* Polo shirt £9.95  
\* Additionally £2.50 for an embroidered name

If you request your name to be embroidered then the capitalisation will be as-is (i.e. veltas and Veltas are different) since it seems to matter to people. I will probably confirm with you if you use all lower-case since some people write like that but would not want their name actually embroidered in lower-case (unless you specify explicitly).

Embroidered name cost is for people who want an embroidered name. (obvious statement is obvious, but I had to confirm)
