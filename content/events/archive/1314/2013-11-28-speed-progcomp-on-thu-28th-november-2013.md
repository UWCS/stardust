Speed programming competition, open for anyone to enter.

There will be several rounds of increasingly difficult problems requiring a simple programming solution that people will attempt to code as quickly as possible in a language of their choice (subject to us being able to run their code on the machines in DCS).

This progcomp will be sponsored by RedGate so there will be some kind of awesome prize\! [Here's the RedGate website](http://www.red-gate.com) , and details of the [fabulous prize](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Leap-Motion-Controller-Interacts-Airspace/dp/B00C66Z9ZC)\!

Questions can be found [here](http://ruth.uwcs.co.uk/progcomp/271113/questions.pdf).
