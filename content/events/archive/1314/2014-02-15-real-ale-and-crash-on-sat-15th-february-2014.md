Every year we go to the Real Ale Festival and it's always great fun. We will be meeting on the Piazza at 19:45.  
We'll also be going to Crash\! afterwards so join us there for even more fun.

"The festival is run entirely by Warwick University students, with volunteering bar staff from all parts of the university. Come along and enjoy the best mix of traditional British culture with today’s students, that all of UK has to offer.

A whopping 120 different beers as well as ciders, fruit wines, mead, and the infamous Turbo Purple are making an appearance this year."

Whether you drink or not this is a great festival, there is usually a hog roast too\!
