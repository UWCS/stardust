In opposite lab to gaming we're holding XING again this week.

We'll try and come up with some projects to work on together while we're here. While finishing any of these projects would be nice, we're at least consistent in having a good time.

It's a nice atmosphere for working on pretty much anything programming related, even if you're working on something completely different to what everyone else is doing\!
