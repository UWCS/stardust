Friday night gaming, loads of consoles and PCs to use. You don’t need to bring anything, just turn up :)

If you don’t have access to the building, knock on the window of the room we’re in and we’ll let you in.

Since this gaming is possibly near all exec's exams we may have to end earlier than usual, if you are committed to 8am after staying beyond a certain point you should check with the exec on hand to see if you need to leave with the last buses etc.
