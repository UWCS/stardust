XING Is Not Gaming (it’s programming and stuff during gaming).

Come look for us programmer-types in the lab opposite where the main gaming events happen.

Bro-grammers, she-grammers and coders even are welcome. Non-programmers may wish to come for help getting started.

Typically we’ll just sit around and work on projects. We seem to help each other a lot with stuff, and it’s generally a nice environment for getting things done.

Also, free crisps usually.
