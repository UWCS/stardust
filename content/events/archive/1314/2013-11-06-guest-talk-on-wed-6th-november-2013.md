Steven from ComputerMinds will be coming in to give us a talk:

Title:  
Do IT projects \*always\* fail, go over budget, and disappoint?

Abstract:  
Between the theoretical dream of Agile software development and fixed price waterfalls of project management there is the hard reality of delivering a IT project with a fixed budget but changing requirements.  
We explore some real world examples of how software projects have run and what compromises have had to be made to deliver on time and on budget.
