XING Is Not Gaming is a get-together for programmers and/or anyone interested in programming or learning how to program. We work on projects together, separately, and give each other help. Although sometimes people do work at XING, it's generally all leisurely programming.

Since this XING/gaming is possibly near all exec's exams we may have to end earlier than usual, if you are committed to 8am after staying beyond a certain point you should check with the exec on hand to see if you need to leave with the last buses etc.
