Speed programming competition, open for anyone to enter.

There will be several rounds of increasingly difficult problems requiring a simple programming solution that people will attempt to code as quickly as possible in a language of their choice (subject to us being able to run their code on the machines in DCS).

There will be small prizes for the top entrants\!

Questions are at [here](http://ruth.uwcs.co.uk/progcomp/141113/questions.pdf)
