Speed programming competition, open for anyone to enter.

There will be several rounds of increasingly difficult problems requiring a simple programming solution that people will attempt to code as quickly as possible in a language of their choice (subject to us being able to run their code on the machines in DCS).

There will be small prizes for the top entrants\!

The questions can be found here: [Questions](http://ruth.uwcs.co.uk/progcomp/151013/ProgComp151013.pdf)
