Speed programming competition, open for anyone to enter.

There will be several rounds of increasingly difficult problems requiring a simple programming solution that people will attempt to code as quickly as possible in a language of their choice (subject to us being able to run their code on the machines in DCS).

There will be small prizes for the top entrants\!

Feel free to work from home. When the competition starts, questions and data will be available [here](http://www.ruth.uwcs.co.uk/progcomp/301013). Please email your solutions to academic-president@uwcs.co.uk before the competition is over.
