Exams are finished, but it is still to long to wait till BFL. Don't worry as UWCS is going GO-KARTING.

We will be meeting up on the central plaza at 14:20 (please be there on time). We hope to return alive around 19:00 the same day for Friday Gaming.

Prices are as followed:  
Student (require proof on day) = £30 + cost transport  
Adult = £50 + cost of transport

Cost of transport will be added on a later date once we know numbers.  
(so if you wan to come please put you name as soon as possible\!)  
The cost gives everyone a total of an hour on the tracks, safety equipment and transport there and back.

PLEASE READ THIS\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  
To secure a booking, we are required to pay in full before the day.  
AS of such if you don't provide your share of cost by 11/06/2014 YOU DON'T GO\!\!\!\!\!  
Please hand your money to either Martin (robot) or Chris (Veltas)
