To get to the Pub simply hop on a No.12 bus from either Campus or Westwood toward Coventry which will takes 10-15 mins tops and you'll see the pub (The City Arms) on the corner of a small roundabout. We are pretty easy to spot and if you email me in advance: phucfl@warwick.ac.uk I can give you a phone number to ring if you're lost. I look forward to seeing you there.
