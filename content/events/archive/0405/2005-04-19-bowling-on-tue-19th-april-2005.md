Come to say hi to Compsoc at a welcome back bowling social\! We will be going to Wetherspoons from 6.30 pm for dinner and/or a drink and then moving on to MegaBowl for 9pm (tbc). Transport will be arranged closer to the event. By signing up to this event you are committing to paying £4 for two student games of bowling whether you come or not as I will have to pay in advance. :-) If you have had a fear of bowling balls since you were a small child and would only like to come for dinner, please still join us, but there is no need to sign up\! I'm looking forward to seeing everyone there\! :o)
