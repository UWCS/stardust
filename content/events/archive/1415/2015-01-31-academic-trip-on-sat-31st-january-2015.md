FOSDEM is a free event that offers open source communities a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Some of CompSoc's members will be attending this event, and we invite anyone interested to signup and come along. We will be travelling to Brussels on the EuroStar, departing 0858 on Friday the 30th of January, and returning on the 1952 train on Sunday the 1st of February.

Please note that you are responsible for your own arrangements / accommodation and we are simply extending an offer to meet up and travel to the conference together.
