Comp Soc’s weekly 12-hour long gaming session: super spooky version

Because we have LAN on saturday from 3pm on saturday, this gaming session will be ending at 2am (which I hope is before the last bus. Let me know if it isn't) so everyone has a chance to rest up before LAN.

Takes place in terminal room 001 in the Department of Computer Science. Not all student cards will give access to the building so knock on one of the windows if you need to be let in.

Because it's Halloween, we may be doing some spooky events along with the regular gaming experience.
