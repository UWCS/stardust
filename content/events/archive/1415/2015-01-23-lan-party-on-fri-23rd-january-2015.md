It's cold outside but the heat of our many computers will keep us warm.

Our LAN parties last almost 48 hours from 7:00pm on friday to 5:00pm on sunday. Don’t worry, though\! You don’t have to stay there the whole time. There will always be a member of exec in the room, supervising and keeping an eye on your belongings.

All LANs take place in LIB 2, the entrance to which is just to the right of the Library Cafe.

Just sign up below and put yourself on the seating plan to join in the fun\!
