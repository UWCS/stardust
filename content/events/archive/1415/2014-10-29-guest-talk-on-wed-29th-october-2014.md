PlayStation has become one of the most distinctive and recognisable brands in the world. The PlayStation 2 reshaped the gaming industry, and remains the biggest selling gaming console in history with over 160 million units sold. The latest iteration, the PlayStation 4, sold 1 million consoles in its first 24 hours on sale, becoming the fastest selling console in history. PlayStation continues to outsell its rivals by 3:1 in Europe.

In this special guest lecture Jim Ryan, President and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and graduate of WBS, talks about the evolution of PlayStation across EMEA, and provides key insights into the development and growth of the world’s leading gaming brand.
