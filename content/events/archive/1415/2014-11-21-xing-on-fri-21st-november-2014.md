A get-together of people for coding and other related projects, this week in LIB2 during LAN.

XING (XING Is Not Gaming, a [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym)) sessions are open to people of all experiences (including none), if you're interested but not sure you should come along because there's always something to do or some way we can help you.

Ask for Veltas or rayhaan. We should be identifiable by the seating plan.
