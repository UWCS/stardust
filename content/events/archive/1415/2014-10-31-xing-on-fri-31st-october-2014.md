A get-together of people in DCS for programming and other related projects, in the other DCS lab at the same time as gaming.

XING (XING Is Not Gaming, a [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym)) sessions are open to people of all experiences (including none), if you're interested but not sure you should come along because there's always something to do or some way we can help you.
