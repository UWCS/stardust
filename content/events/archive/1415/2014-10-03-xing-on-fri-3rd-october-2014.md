XING is a get-together of people in DCS for programming and other related projects.

This week there will be a theme at XING (completely optional, of course), or rather some kind of project or aim that people can work together on. XING lasts well into the night, but the theme will probably mainly be a thing at more sensible hours. I will put more info here before the day.

XING is open to people of all experiences, if you’re interested but not sure you should come along because there’s always something to do or some way we can help you.
