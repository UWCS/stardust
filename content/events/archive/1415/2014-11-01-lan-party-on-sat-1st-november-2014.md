The first LAN Party of the year\! -And this year it's on Halloween\! Spoooky.- Unfortunately due to room booking issues, we do not have the room on friday evening and so this LAN will no longer be taking place on Halloween.

\-Our LAN parties last almost 48 hours from 7:00pm on friday to 5:00pm on sunday.- This LAN only lasts from 3:00pm on saturday to 7:00pm on sunday, due to the aformentioned room booking issues.

Don't worry, though\! You don't have to stay there the whole time. There will always be a member of exec in the room, supervising and keeping an eye on your belongings.

All LANs take place in LIB 2, the entrance to which is just to the right of the Library Cafe.

Just sign up below and put yourself on the seating plan to join in the fun\!
