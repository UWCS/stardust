Ice Skating - The best way to acquire bruises or to laugh at other people getting them\!\! Even if you just want to watch or have never been skating before this will be brilliant fun\! No laughing at members of CompSoc, but the general public are more than fair game\! We will be meeting at the Ice rink next to the Skydome in Coventry at 1.30 pm this Saturday (end of week 7). If you have any problems finding it my number is 07843 203594. After Skating we will be going for some dinner and the pub crawl. Bring an extra pair of socks, and wear a warm jumper\! The session costs £6 and skate hire costs £1.50. However if we get 15 people or more nobody needs to pay skate hire, so if you think you are going to come, please sign up so I have an idea of numbers.
