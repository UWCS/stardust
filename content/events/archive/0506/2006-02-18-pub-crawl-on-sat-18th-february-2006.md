It's the CompSoc Pub Crawl Mark 2\!\! We will be having dinner in the City Arms at 5 pm then starting the crawl at 7pm. The route will be very similar to last time, and will be subject to change on the night. The plan is to go to the following pubs: The City Arms, The Albany, The Aardvark, The Shakespeare, The City Wall and The Old Windmill. If you can't find us at any point during the night then just give me a call on 07843 203594. Don't worry if you don't want to drink, there will be plenty of sober people there too, and lots of drunk people to laugh at\! Don't forget to also sign up for Ice Skating which will be happening at 1.30 that afternoon.
