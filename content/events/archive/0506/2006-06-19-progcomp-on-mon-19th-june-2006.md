Entrants should be alone, and not in teams - this is not enforced, but the prizes will have individuals in mind.  1st, 2nd and 3rd place will be determined by popular choice in a showcase of the demos at 14:00 Friday at the MegaLAN.  You do not have to be at the MegaLAN to join this competition, as long as your submissions get to db\_rat before 12:00 on the Friday.  There will be a theme for creations to be announced 12:00 Monday.
