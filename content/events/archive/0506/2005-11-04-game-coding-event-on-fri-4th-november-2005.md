Despite it's name, the game coding competition's not just open to coders\! If you're able to 3d model or draw artwork then you'd almost certainly be welcomed into one of the teams.  
  
Preliminary signups for the 48-hour game coding competition. Anyone interested in taking part, sign up here and leave a few suggestions for game themes. We'll whip up some kind of voting system and have a vote on the themes in around two weeks time.
