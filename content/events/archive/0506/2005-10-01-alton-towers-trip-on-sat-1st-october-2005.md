Alton Towers\!\!\!\! What more can be said? - If you want to come and be a big kid for the day, sign up now\! I would really appreciate people to sign up asap as I need to know numbers so I can be sure we all have a way to get there\!\! Unless anyone comes up with money off vouchers, it should cost everyone Â£15 plus a small amount for petrol\! I will be booking the tickets on Oct 1st (when signups officially close) so if you decide you want to go after that it will be more expensive, you will have to get the ticket yourself and I will be less likely to be able to find you transport. If there are any problems email me (chloe) at c.m.dives@warwick.ac.uk or send me a tell on irc.
