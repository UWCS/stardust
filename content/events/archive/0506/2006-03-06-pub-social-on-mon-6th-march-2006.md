This week the pub social will be in the lovely Old Clarence. They stop taking food orders at 9, so beware being late\! To get there by bus take the no 12 from campus (or Leamington) to the Hearsal common bus stop, walk in the direction the bus was travelling (towards the city arms with Hearsal Common on your right) and the pub is on the first corner you get to, just after the Common ends. A map can be found at http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q\&hl=en\&q=the+old+clarence,+coventry\&cid=52405833,-1512634,701690184295265394\&li=lmd\&t=m\&ll=52.40272,-1.535146\&spn=0.002939,0.007317 . Look Forward to seeing you all there for some yummy food\!
