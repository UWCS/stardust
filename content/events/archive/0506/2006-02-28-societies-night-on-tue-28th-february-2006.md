The Societies Night is a free event in the union on the night that the societies awards are to be announced. There will be a free RAG quiz, and at the same time chicken and vegetable curries will be served from south central for Â£3. There will also be free entry to the Real Ale Festival. This is instead of the usual Socs Fed Ball. I can imagine this being a brilliant night out, so come along to join a compsoc quiz team to prove we are all amazingly smart\! :oD
