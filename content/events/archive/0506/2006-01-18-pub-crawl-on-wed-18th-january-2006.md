We will be meeting at 6.30 at the main campus bus stop, or 7 in the City Arms. A rough route for the crawl will be - The City Arms, The Albany, The Aardvark, The Old Windmill, The Shakespeare and The Town Crier. This route will be subject to change depending on how we feel on the night so if you have trouble finding us on the night my number is 07843 203594. Don't worry if you don't want to drink, there will be other people there not drinking, and it won't be expected of you at all\! This is a great oportunity to chat to lots of people through the night as we move from pub to pub, and to hopefully try some new pubs in the area\!
