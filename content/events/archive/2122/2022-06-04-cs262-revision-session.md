In this session for second year computer science students, we'll be running through content and questions from CS262 Logic & Verification. Our last revision session mainly concerned first order logic models and SAT, so this time we'll be covering first order logic proofs, Hoare triples, and of course Prolog. Finally, we'll discuss some general tips for the exam. There will also be snacks for those answering questions\!
