We've got another LAN coming up, kicking off on Friday night, all the way until Sunday\! Whether you want to bring your own computer and play until the early hours, drop by to take part in tournaments or quizzes, or just vibe with friends and queue up increasingly terrible music, we should have something for everyone.

**Signups are now open\! Check out the signup link on this page to book your seat now\!**
