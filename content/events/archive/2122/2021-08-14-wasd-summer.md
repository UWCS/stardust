As many of you may already be aware, CompSoc runs WASD (Warwickâ€™s Awesome Speedruns and Demos) - an annual charity speedrunning event that has taken place annually since 2016. This year, we are starting a sister event: WASD Summer.  

#### **WHEN AND WHERE**

The event will run on the **14th and 15th of August 2021** and will be held entirely online.  

#### **CHARITY**

Once again, donations to the event are in support of the wonderful UK charity SpecialEffect (<https://www.specialeffect.org.uk/>), whose mission is to put fun and inclusion back into the lives of people with physical disabilities, by helping them to play video games.  

#### **GETTING INVOLVED**

We're open to anyone of any level of ability, provided you are able to run a game reasonably fast and can guarantee you'll be able to stream your full run on the date of the event. Please also submit an example of your run so we have an idea what to expect.

Signups are now closed, but you can watch the event live on <https://www.twitch.tv/warwickspeedrun>
