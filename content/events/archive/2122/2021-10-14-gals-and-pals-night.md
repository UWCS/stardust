Do you want to meet more women and non-binary friends in UWCS? Now's your chance\!

Join us this Thursday for a new type of social, aimed towards the typically underrepresented genders of UWCS\!

We're going to be meeting outside the DCS building at 5.30pm and walking over to the Phantom Coach together.

**Disclaimer:** There is absolutely no pressure to drink. The idea is to sit and have a meal together, and do what most STEM students hate - socialise\!

Any questions or concerns? Get in touch with Josh or Ella\!
