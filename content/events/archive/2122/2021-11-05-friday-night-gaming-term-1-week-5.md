We've secured the ground floor of DCS, and we'll holding a gaming stakeout from 7pm until midnight\! To tide you over, we've got a bunch of games, consoles, and of course the ability to use your own Steam library\*.

\*we think we fixed it, but bring us over if anything explodes

If you wanna order any food while you're there, we'd be happy to help with sorting it out - personally, I'd recommend grouping up with a bunch of others and ordering at the same time for a big discount\!

We'll be taking the following safety precautions for this event:

  - Social distancing and mask wearing will be enforced for the duration of the event unless you are exempt
  - Hand sanitiser and wipes will be available and their use will be strongly encouraged. All shared surfaces and controllers will be sanitised before and after every use.
  - A thermometer is on hand to check attendee's temperature on arrival.
  - We strongly encourage you to complete a lateral flow test before arriving, and have the NHS Covid-19 app installed and active.
  - Event attendees will be asked to sign in on arrival and provide their email address in the event an attendee later tests positive and we need to trace contacts.
