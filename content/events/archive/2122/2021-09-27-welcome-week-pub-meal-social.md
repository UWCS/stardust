Every Monday at 7pm we walk to the Phantom Coach pub in Canley for a meal and a drink in our weekly casual social. It's a good opportunity to meet the other members of the society and students with shared interests.

We'll meet at the Department of Computer Science building (DCS) at 6:30pm every Monday before heading over as a group. However, if you can't make it then, or need to make alternative travel arrangements, do feel free to meet us at the pub from 7.
