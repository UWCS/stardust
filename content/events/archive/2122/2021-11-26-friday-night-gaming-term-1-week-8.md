We've secured the ground floor of DCS, and we'll holding a gaming stakeout from 7pm until midnight\! To tide you over, we've got a bunch of games, consoles, VR, and of course the ability to use your own Steam library\*.

If you want to order any food while you're there, we'd be happy to help with sorting it out - we'd recommend grouping up with a bunch of others and ordering at the same time for a big discount\!
