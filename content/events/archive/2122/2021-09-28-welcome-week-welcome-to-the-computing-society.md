Welcome to the Computing Society\! This talk will introduce you to who we all are, what we do, and some (hopefully) useful information from the perspective of current students. Also, feel free to ask us questions at the end\!

***We currently plan to hold this event in-person following the University's COVID-19 guidelines, in addition to livestreaming the event. We will provide links and more details closer to the time.***
