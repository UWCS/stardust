#### Embedded Programming in Rust

An intro to the Rust language, the concept of embedded programming, and trying get an LED to blink.

#### How do I React?

Why is everyone and their Mum using React? This talk gives an introduction to the basic principles of React, and why you should use it for your next web UI.
