We'll kick of our academic events of the year with a talk introducing the society and its exec, before holding a talk on the basics of Git: a useful piece of version control software that will aid you throughout your degree and career, given by one of our former presidents.

If you wish to come in person, you will need to book onto the event via the Welcome Week timetable. A link to the event will be provided once the timetable is finalised. Unfortunately, we only have a capacity of 25 to attend in person due to social distancing requirements. CS1.04 can be found on the campus map with this link: <http://campus-cms.warwick.ac.uk/share/dc29e7979340b389ffbc7123bd120af1>

The event will be livestreamed and recorded for the benefit of people who cannot make it onto campus. The audience will not be included in the recording, but any questions you ask will be. We'll be livestreaming this on Teams and will provide a link closer to the time.

If safety precautions permit it, we will be providing free pizza at the event.

***(Please note this event is subject to changing social distancing rules, and may be moved online)***
