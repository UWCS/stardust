Calling all sigma\* enjoyers - we're doing a revision session for second year students taking CS259 Formal Languages. Whether you're wrapping your head around undecidability, pumping those strings up and down, or starting to draw out your very first DFAs (which are also NFAs), hopefully you'll get something out of it\! If you want any specific topics covering, then feel free to send over your least favourite questions. That's **14th June, at 2pm, in MB0.08** (Stats building). Hope to see you there\!
