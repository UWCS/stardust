Come enjoy copious amounts of ale, mead and cider with us at Warwick's annual real ale festival\! The fabulously dirty Dr. Busker will also be returning to perform, definitely an act not to be missed\!

We are meeting beforehand for a meal in the Dirty Duck at half six, then heading to the copper rooms once everyone is ready.

Feel free to just come along to the meal if you don't fancy any ale or meet us there as there is a hog roast.

Hope to see you there\!
