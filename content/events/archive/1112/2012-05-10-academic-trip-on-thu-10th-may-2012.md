We are running a trip to Bletchley Park, the world renowned secret wartime code breaking site and birthplace of the modern computer.  
There will be a tour around the site and a talk specially for us about cryptanalysis and the Enigma machine.

We will be meeting outside the Department of Computer Science at 9am and getting a minibus to Bletchley Park.  
This trip will cost £3 each to cover fuel costs, we are subsidising the cost of the tour and talks.  
There is a cafeteria there or you can bring a packed lunch with you.
