This week we are having a special Starcraft gaming to launch the tournament we are running this term\! This means there will be a lot of social Starcraft being played :D

Games commonly played: DOTA, Starcraft II, Trackmania, Rockband/Guitar Hero, Super Smash Bro.s Melee & Brawl, Mario Kart Wii etc.

XING: Xing Is Not Gaming, is our weekly programming workshop where you can come to us for personal project help as well as collaborating on society projects. Here is our Github for an idea of what we get up to: https://github.com/UWCS/

Don't worry if you don't have a DCS login as these are provided :)
