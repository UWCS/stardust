The topic of the talk:  
Title: Taming scalability, and how XP can help

Who: Imran Bohoran and Benji Weber (Unruly Media)

Abstract:  
In this talk we will discuss three types of scaling challenges involved with adserving - Performance, Reliability, and Innovation.

We will cover some of the performance challenges we have encountered growing to tens of millions of impressions per day, and the approach we took to solve them, together with reliability challenges and how we avoid being woken up every night. We'll pass on some lessons that we have learnt the hard way - so you won't have to.

Teams often get less and less innovative when they have to cope with these kinds of scalability problems and increasingly complex business requirements. We will explain how Extreme Programming allows us to cope with these challenges and release new features into production to millions of users several times a day, while still having time to innovate.

Hope to see you there\!

Following the talk we will be having a meal in the dirty duck which all are welcome to join us with. We will then be heading over to DCS for gaming and XING, our weekly programming workshop.
