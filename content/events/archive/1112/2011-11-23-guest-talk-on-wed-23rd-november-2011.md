Machine Learning in the Real World - CoreFiling Limited  
\=======================================================

Using Machine Learning To Solve Real-World Problems

How do you approach a classification problem involving thousands of categories  
rather than the 'usual' five or six? What happens when your data-set is several  
gigabytes and growing? What open-source tools are available, are they any good,  
and can they be put to commercial use? How do you measure the system's effectiveness  
when you're not allowed to see the real data because of client confidentiality?

David North, from Oxford-based software company CoreFiling, will aim to answer all  
these questions and more in a talk on machine learning from an industry perspective.
