Come along to Cosmo, a quality all-you-can-eat in the centre of Coventry, to see out the old exec and welcome in the new.  
There will hopefully be a speech by the old presidents and more importantly copious amounts of food.

We will be meeting on campus by the Arts Centre bus stop beforehand with the intent to get the bus into Coventry at 18:35.  
If you wish to meet us there then let us know in advance so we aren't waiting for any ghosts at the bus stop.

The meal will cost £12.50 for all you can eat, bring your university ID for potential discount.
