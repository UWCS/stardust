Neural Interfaces - An Experimental Tour  
Speaker:  
Professor Kevin Warwick,  
School of Systems Engineering,  
University of Reading.

In this presentation a practical look is taken at how the use of implant and electrode technology can be employed to diminish the effects of certain neural illnesses by opening up a new path between the brain and technology. However as a result this also results in biological brains for robots and enables human enhancement. In all cases the end result is to increase the range of abilities of the recipients. An indication is given of a number of areas in which such technology has already had a profound effect, a key element being the need for a clear interface linking a biological brain directly with computer technology.

The emphasis is clearly placed on experimental scientific studies that have been and are being undertaken and reported on. The area of focus is notably the need for a biological/technological connection, where a link is made directly with the cerebral cortex and/or nervous system. The presentation will also consider the future: in which robots have biological, or part-biological, brains and in which neural implants link the human nervous system bi-directionally with technology and the internet.
