3D printing is a now-mainstream technology that can be used to fabricate props, trinkets, spare parts, digital art, and other items in plastic. Prints can be designed by a yourself, downloaded from the internet, or 3D scanned using dedicated applications.  

  
This talk by the Computing Society is aiming to introduce 3D printing and its key concepts to people of any level of technical skill\! It will cover the basics of 3D printing, where to find designs online or how to create them, give a few apps for 3D scanning, and how to request use of the CompSoc 3D printer. CompSoc will also be providing free pizza for those attending the talk\! So we have a reasonable estimate on numbers, if you are planning on coming along please note your interest on the Facebook event.

  
This talk has been sponsored by UK-based 3D printing filament supplier Rigid.ink, who supply CompSoc with the filament we use for printing.
