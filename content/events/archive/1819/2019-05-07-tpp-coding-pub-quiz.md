After the success of the previous coding pub quiz last term, TPP are back to run another one\!

Unlike a typical pub quiz, you’ll need to exercise your problem solving skills to tackle the range of challenges set instead of applying your general knowledge.

There will be free food and drinks, both soft and alcoholic, available for attendees throughout the whole event. There will also be great prizes on offer for the winning teams.

We recommend teams of about 5-6 people, but smaller groups are welcome too, and if you’re unsure who to come with then we’ll be happy to match you up with other keen problem solvers on the day. Some questions require specific knowledge so you will want a programmer on your team, and don’t forget to bring a laptop\!
