We're circling again\! This time weeks 1 and 7 in the Copper Rooms\!  

  

We're doing themes now, so come as something VIDEO GAME related. Wearing a costume isn't mandatory, but the best dressed will get a prize.

  

Tickets for week 1 are likely to go fast, so be sure to pick one up asap (I believe they go on sale at noon on the 3rd). Make sure you get a circling ticket rather than a regular event ticket if you want to join the circle.
