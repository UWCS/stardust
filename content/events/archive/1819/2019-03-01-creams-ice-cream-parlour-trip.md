There's a place in Leamington that does ice cream and we're going there to get some ice cream and chill for a bit.  
  
We'll meet up on campus at the bus interchange at 6 and head back around 8 for our weekly gaming night.  
  
Alternatively, if you're not coming to gaming, you're in Leamington on a Friday night; I'm sure you can find some way to entertain yourself.
