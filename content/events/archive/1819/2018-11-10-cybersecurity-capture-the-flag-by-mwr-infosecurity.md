We're hosting a cybersecurity event, in partnership with MWR InfoSecurity\!  

The CTF format would be Jeopardy style, with a variety of challenges each with one or more flags. Typically in the past, we have run these with one man teams. There aren't any specific hardware requirements, all the challenges should easily be solvable on a laptop with no custom hardware required.
