Professional penetration tester and OSCP Cory Stone will illustrate the stages of exploiting a system from end to end. Starting with reconnaissance through to exploitation and eventually privilege escalation and lateral movement, practical examples will be given to illustrate how different services can be exploited at each stage of the cyber kill chain. Attendees will then be introduced to each of the tools necessary to get started on hacking their way through online challenges and CTFs. This will be followed by a live demo, which will demonstrate the methodology and problem solving required to excel as a penetration tester. The event will benefit anyone from complete beginner to experienced hackers.
