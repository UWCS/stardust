Summer LAN is back once again\!

While our usual LANs take place over a weekend, Summer LAN runs from Monday to Friday. While it isn't strictly necessary to bring your own equipment for the Summer LAN, as we'll also be running community games, desk space is limited. Be sure to sign up [here](https://warwick.gg/events/summer-lan-2019) to reserve your space\! A list of equipment you'll need to bring if you're bringing a PC or console can also be found under the Info tab.
