After the success of the talks last year CompSoc are pleased to announce a third guest talk from CoreFiling Ltd (http://www.corefiling.com/).

Abstract:  
"A talk about how continuous integration is a key tool for the rapid development of high-quality, reliable software. Topics will include an introduction to the ideas of continuous integration, an overview of some of the systems which implement it, how CoreFiling built their own system in the absence of a suitable alternative, challenges and limitations of CI, and an exploration of some of the emerging ideas which build on it, such as continuous deployment. The talk will last approximately 45 minutes and there will be an opportunity to ask questions."

This will be particularly relevant to 2nd year students currently studying Software Engineering Principles.

The talk will take place in S0.13 from 5pm on Thursday 22nd November.
