The Internet Problem Solving Contest is an online contest for teams consisting of up to three people. Several problems will be published at the beginning of the competition. Each problem consists of a problem description and two input data sets. To solve a problem you will have to compute correct output data for the given input data sets. Usually this means that you will write a program that solves the problem, but you may produce the output by hand or in any other way.

The contest will take place on 8th June. The contest takes 5 hours and will be from 11-4.

You must register your teams online and add your team to the sign-ups list so we know whose scores to look at - registrations are [here](http://ipsc.ksp.sk/contests/ipsc2013/register). If you don't have a team yet just edit your sign-up later, there'll probably be other people looking for team members in DCS on the day.

We will be coding together in DCS in terminal room 1 on the day for team spirit and good fun\! Don’t worry if you don’t have a DCS login as accounts can be provided for the day, and feel free to bring along your own laptop if you’d rather use your own computer. In DCS we'll also be providing free pizza for lunch, and some general freebies\! However as this is an online competition you can code from home if you'd prefer, just remember to give us your team name in the sign-up below.

There will be a prize awarded to the best team of £100 worth of Amazon vouchers.

This event is open to everyone - it can be competitive but it's also just fun to try to solve the problems together and have a go\!

Good luck\!
