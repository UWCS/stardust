Steven Jones from Coventry based company [ComputerMinds](http://www.computerminds.co.uk/) is coming in to give a talk on open source, Drupal and the web. ComputerMinds build dynamic, data driven websites for UK and European organisations. Steven Jones himself is a Maths graduate from Warwick and many of his colleagues are Computer Science graduates from Warwick.

Drupal is one of the largest open source communities in the world and powers a lot of websites around the world, and has particular strengths in government, notably most US government departments have a Drupal website, or are moving toward one.

It is sure to be an interesting talk for anyone interested in the web who wants to learn more about open source.

Hope to see you there\!
