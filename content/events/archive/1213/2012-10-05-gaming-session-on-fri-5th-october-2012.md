The first weekly gaming session / XING of the year :)

Comp soc take over the Department of Computer Science terminal rooms to play some games and program together.

Games commonly played: DOTA, Starcraft II, Trackmania, Rockband/Guitar Hero, Super Smash Bro.s Melee & Brawl, Mario Kart Wii etc.

XING: Xing Is Not Gaming, is our weekly programming workshop where you can come to us for personal project help as well as collaborating on society projects. Here is our Github for an idea of what we get up to: https://github.com/UWCS/
