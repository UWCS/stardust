Do you want to pretend you're in the middle of a post apocalyptic war against tyranic robots?  
Do you want to shoot people in Compsoc?  
This event might be for you\!

We will be meeting at 5pm on the Piazza (white circular area by the Student's Union) to get on a bus into Coventry.  
The event will cost Â£10 each and that will get you 4 games.  
We will also be having a meal afterwards, location TBC.
