Speed programming competition, open for anyone to enter.

There will be several rounds of increasingly difficult problems requiring a simple programming solution that people will attempt to code as quickly as possible in a language of their choice (subject to us being able to run their code on the machines in DCS).

Once you're finished there will also be a bonus "golf" problem, where you have to come up with a solution using as few characters as possible.

There will be prizes for the top entrants.
