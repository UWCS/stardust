Compsoc has organised a trip to IBM Hursley Park, one of IBM’s biggest software development labs, for Wednesday 6th February (Week 5). IBM have arranged a wide spread of speakers and fascinating demonstrations (especially if previous trips are anything to go by\!) so anyone going will be sure to see/hear some interesting material.

An executive coach will be booked to take a maximum of 43 people, leaving campus at 8:40am and for the return trip leaving Hursley at 4:45pm. The trip is free, but do only sign up if you are definitely coming as limited spaces means it’d be unfair on others. You don’t need to be a member of the Computing Society to come along – the event is open to all students. We are asking for a £5 deposit that will be refunded to you on the day in order to book your place for the trip. Please give this to an exec member at one of our events or around DCS.

To sign up please send us an email with your name and student number to : academic-president@uwcs.co.uk
