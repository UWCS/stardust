We will be going to see Wreck-it Ralph in Odeon in Coventry. Unfortunately, the 2D Wreck-it Ralph is too early (at 1.30pm) therefore, we will watch the 3D one instead.

The ticket prices range from £8-9 depending on whether you're a student or adult. You need to bring your own pair of 3D glasses, or buy a pair at odean for £1.

We will be meeting at the piazza at 4.30pm to catch the bus together.

Please sign-up if you are interested in coming\!

Synopsis: 'Ralph (John C. Reilly) is tired of being overshadowed by Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer), the "good guy" star of their game who always gets to save the day. But after decades doing the same thing and seeing all the glory go to Felix, Ralph decides he's tired of playing the role of a bad guy. He takes matters into his own massive hands and sets off on a game-hopping journey across the arcade through every generation of video games to prove he's got what it takes to be a hero. On his quest, he meets the tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) from the first-person action game Hero's Duty. But it's the feisty misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) from the candy-coated cart racing game, Sugar Rush, whose world is threatened when Ralph accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens the entire arcade. Will Ralph realize his dream and save the day before it's too late?'
