We're doing a group trip to The Farmhouse during BFL.

If you want to come you should sign up so we have an idea of the numbers, if you want to walk with us from LIB2 we'll be leaving at about 5:45, most of the exec are going so just find one of those for more info at the time.

The Farmhouse is a family restaurant serving tasty Indian and English food that's a reasonable amount further than the place where we have our weekly pub social, and the location of holiday pub.
