(UPDATE: WE WILL BE GETTING THE 10:17am TRAIN FROM CANLEY STATION (takes 20 mins to walk to the station from campus), MEETING AT THE STATION AT 10am)

Together with Maths and Pride we'll be heading to Bletchley Park and the National Museum of Computing on Saturday of week three (October the 24th).

We'll also be just in time to catch the Imitation Game exhibition before it closes for some Cumbercrypt\!

To save on costs, we are organising travel by train. You need to book your own tickets, and details of train times will follow (don't book just yet). We are planning to leave around 10am, and return by 4.30pm. Train travel is just over an hour.

We will book a group ticket for the park, for which we need precise numbers. Further details will be posted on the event later. The expected cost of the group ticket will be £10 per person, though if we cannot confirm numbers soon enough this will have to be £15. Train travel is around £10 return without a railcard. The computing museum is not included in the park ticket, and unfortunately we can't group book it, so anyone interested can pay £5 on the door.

Bletchley park has full wheelchair access and is a 3 minute walk from the station, any other access needs or general concerns please contact mcnutty (William Seymour). This includes those with financial concerns, no promises but we will see what we can do :)
