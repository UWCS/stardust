This talk will be taking place in CS0.07

Join our technical officer Rayhaan for a brief introduction to the Linux shell. We'll start off with the basics before focusing on connecting to the UWCS IRC (Internet Relay Chat) network, which is the main way in which we communicate with each other in the society.

While the talk has traditionally been aimed at new members of the society, this year we're also welcoming students taking CS133 who want to gain a better grasp of the shell :)

Afterwards we'll be heading to Varsity for our weekly pub social.
