It's time to announce our AGM and elections\! We will be running a "stand up on the day" election, meaning that you won't be able to submit a manifesto before hand, and you can just turn up and run for positions on the day. YOU MUST BE A MEMBER OF COMPSOC THREE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION TO VOTE OR STAND\! You're welcome to announce to whoever you want that you're running before hand though\! Please be prepared to give a speech about why you should be chosen for the role, and to answer questions. We strongly encourage people to run for an exec position, even if you've only turned up to one or even no events, and first years are also very welcome. Feel free to email/facebook/talk to any exec if you have questions\! For the list of positions, see this link: https://uwcs.co.uk/cms/contact/
