Every Monday since time began we've headed out the pub for food and a drink (if that's your thing - for many of us it isn't). We currently go to Varsity, just outside of campus. Either meet us there or find us in the computer science atrium 15 minutes before and we'll walk over together.

If you're a fresher then come and say hi\! We'd love to meet you, and you can get to know people before gaming on Friday. If you study computer science then it's also a great way to get the insider story and make some friends in later years.
