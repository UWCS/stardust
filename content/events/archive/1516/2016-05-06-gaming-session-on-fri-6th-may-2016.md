Mega gaming session from 8pm-8am in the Department of Computer Science.

Consoles? All of 'em  
DOTA? Yup  
Smash? Easy  
Tournaments? You bet\!  
Oculus Rift? Sometimes :P

So come along, relax and get to know some fellow gamers. If you have trouble getting into the department just tap on the window and we’ll let you in. We might even let you out again.
