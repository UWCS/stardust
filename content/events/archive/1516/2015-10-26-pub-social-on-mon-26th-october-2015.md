Every Monday since time began we’ve headed out the pub for food and a drink (if that’s your thing – for many of us it isn’t). We currently go to Varsity, just outside of campus.

If you’re a fresher then come and say hi\! We’d love to meet you, and you can get to know people before gaming on Friday. If you study computer science then it’s also a great way to get the insider story and make some friends in later years.
