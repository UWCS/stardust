Mega gaming session from 8pm-8am in the Department of Computer Science.

Consoles? All of 'em  
DOTA? Yup  
Smash? Easy  
Tournaments? You bet\!  
Oculus Rift? Sometimes :P

So come along, relax and get to know some fellow gamers. If you have trouble getting into the department just tap on the window and weâ€™ll let you in. We might even let you out again.
