Regardless of exams, we are continuing 𝕄𝕚𝕝𝕜 𝕄𝕠𝕟𝕕𝕒𝕪𝕤!

**Every** Monday you can find a variety of milks available in the Department of Computer Science Atrium (plant-based options included). Come by, grab a cup, and have a little chat with some of us :)

*𝕄𝕚𝕝𝕜 is ~~definitely~~ proven to help you do better in your exams.*
