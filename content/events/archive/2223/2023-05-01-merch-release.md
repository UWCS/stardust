We are bringing back our merchandise for a ***limited*** time only!

Head on over to the [UWCS Merch Store](https://merch.uwcs.co.uk/) and find our wide variety of options, including the *brand new* Milk Monday mugs and the UWCS sweatshirts with an 𝕖𝕞𝕓𝕣𝕠𝕚𝕕𝕖𝕣𝕖𝕕 𝕝𝕠𝕘𝕠.

We also have some all-time favorites:

- ***programming socks*** that allow you to unleash your full programming potential

- a 54-card deck of ***playing cards*** in the signature UWCS colors *(with some adorable Jokers)*

- comfortable ***hoodies*** with the options of either pull-over or zipped

- ***t-shirts*** available in black, grey, and white with the signature dots on them

 - a desk-sized ***mousepad*** so you never forget you do computer science :)

Merch is available for everyone, so you don't need to be a current society member *(𝘰𝘳 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘯 𝘢 𝘴𝘵𝘶𝘥𝘦𝘯𝘵)* to purchase it!
 
 If you have any questions at all, you can ask in the Discord or email us.
