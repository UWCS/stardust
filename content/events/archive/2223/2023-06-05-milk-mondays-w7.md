Can you believe that this is the *last* f͟i͟r͟s͟t 𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕜 𝕞𝕠𝕟𝕕𝕒𝕪 of the month for the academic year (think about it)? Well, it is! As per usual, we are providing __chocolate milk__, so it is necessary to stop-by and grab some!

**Every** Monday you can find a variety of milks available in the Department of Computer Science Atrium (plant-based options included). Come by, grab a cup, and have a little chat with some of us :)

*𝕄𝕚𝕝𝕜 is d̶e̶f̶i̶n̶i̶t̶e̶l̶y̶ proven to help you do better in your exams.*
