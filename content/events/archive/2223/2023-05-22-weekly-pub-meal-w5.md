Exams suck. We all know this. *Despite this,* please do take a break and go out for some fresh air! Whilst doing that, why don't you join us at our pub meal?

Join us for our weekly pub meal and take a chance to unwind and talk with a few of us whilst we grab a bite to eat!

*We are going to Phantom Coach, so if you want you can pass by DCS a bit early and we will walk on over together*
