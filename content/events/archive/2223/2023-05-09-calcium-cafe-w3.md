**A one-time event, we will be combining Milk Monday with CompCafé due to the Bank Holiday!**

More exams are coming up and everyone is *stressing*, so why not pass by ***Calcium Café!*** and study with us from **5pm** onwards this **Tuesday**! 

If you have any topics you're curious about or need help with, just ask anyone around. We have students from all years here, so someone will be *hopefully* able to help you out!

Don't want to study? No problem! Tons of us love to talk, look at funny content, and just generally destress :)

***Most importantly,*** we will be providing snacks and 𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕜 at *this* specific session, since you need some energy this exam season with all of the studying that will be going on. 

*We hope to see you at the udderly amazing Calcium Café!*
