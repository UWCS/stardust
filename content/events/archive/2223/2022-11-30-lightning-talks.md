We'll have three short talks covering all manner of topics!

**Type Level Arithmetic in Haskell** - Felix B  
Are you tired of using basic, boring programming features like numbers? Think having a standard library is too handhold-y? Fancy doing every last bit of your computation at runtime? Well, have we got the solution for you!

**Mechanistic Interpretability of Neural Networks** - Avi S  
Is it possible to reverse-engineer a trained neural network? Why might it be useful to do so?

- **Formal Concept Analysis** - Josh F   
- A talk on how we can use the concept of concepts to find structures and rules in complex data. And, an example of using FCA to extract meaningful information in action.
