Join us for the first Friday night of term 3!

Most importantly, there will be free pizza! Come around and grab a slice, and stay for a bit for the fun activities available :)

ALSO, a **Big Mario Kart Race** will be going on this Friday Night Gaming, and you do *not* want to miss it! If you just so happen to have a switch with Mario Kart and a Dock lying around, you are essentially obligated to come on over and participate (not seriously but we would love to see you anyways)

Aside from this, we have tons of options for consoles: Xbox with Rockband, Wii, PS4 and moreâ€”all having a wide selection of games.

If you are more into Steam, we have that too! Not only that, but you can get full access to the department computers and enjoy a wide selection of **free** games *(wow!)*

It doesn't stop there folks. We also have a ~~freaking~~ Oculus VR headset, so you can immerse yourself in Metaverse games. Beat Saber is a popular choice, but we have tons of options!

Did you think that was it? We even have Jackbox, along with other party games that will continue through the night. 

If you find yourself available, pop by for Friday Night Gaming and enjoy this huge range of options!
