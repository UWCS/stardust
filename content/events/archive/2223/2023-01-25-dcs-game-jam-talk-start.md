DCS presents... The Great Warwick Game Jam! üçì

Happening from the 25th Jan to the 8th Feb, this university-wide Game Jam is a great incentive to get involved with development - whether you're a programmer or an artist, a musician or a level designer, get involved!

And not only that - there'll be speakers from the industry on various game development topics, and cash prizes of up to ¬£200 for the winning teams!

If that sounds like your jam (pun intended), then sign up with the link: [tinyurl.com/wgj-2023](https://tinyurl.com/wgj-2023)

Contact Alex Dixon (alex.r.dixon@warwick.ac.uk or dixonary#1647) for more info.
