Our very own team programming contest, UWCS Challenge, is happening this Wednesday!

ðŸ”µ Take part in teams of up to 3
ðŸ”º Solve 5 programming challenges of increasing difficulty
ðŸŸ© Score in the top 3 teams to win a concerning amount of chocolate, exclusive t-shirts, and Amazon gift cards!

It's good practice for technical interviews, supported by the Department of Computer Science, and hopefully you'll have a good time. Want to take part? Just grab a team (or don't) and turn up on the day!

Any questions? Drop them in #progcomps on Discord. Hope to see you there... 

Previous questions can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/UWCS/progcomps/releases/tag/v1.1.0), we'll be using our fancy new(ish) marking website for submissions!
