Hi. Thanks for taking the time to read the event description\! Not everyone does this.

This talk is to get you familiar with the Computing Society, because especially if you're taking a CS-related degree, you'll be seeing us a lot. The society has been around since ~~1998~~ 1979, and our purpose is simple - to provide a space for those interested in the field of computer science\! We'll be doing our best to support you throughout your time here, whether that's through academic, gaming, or social events.

We'll be showing you a preview of the events we'll be running throughout the year, as well as some tips, tricks, and warnings from the perspective of actual, real computer science students. We hope to see you there\!
