As a follow-on to CS118 and in preparation for CS126, we'll be covering some more features of Java, to allow you to make better use of the language before the Information Structures Coursework: you first major project in Java.

We'll also be having free pizza! If you are in the Functional Programming lecture beforehand, we'll be in the same room directly after!
