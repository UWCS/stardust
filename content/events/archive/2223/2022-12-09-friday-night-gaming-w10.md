Join us every Friday for a night of fun\!

We have tons of consoles: Xbox with Rockband; two Switches with Mario Kart, Smash Bros and more; Wii, Xbox One and PS4 with a wide selection of games.

The other star of the show is our access to department computers with access to Steam and a selection of free games, there should be something for you to enjoy\!

We also have a Valve Index VR headset, so get yourself immersed in the ~~Metaverse~~ games\! Beat Saber may be the most commonly used, but we have quite the library as well.

Don't worry, we aren't done yet. We'll have a range of Jackbox games and similar party games going throughout the night.
