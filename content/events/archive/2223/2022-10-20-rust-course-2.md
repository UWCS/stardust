Are you ready to learn one of the most loved languages by developers? This week will dig into some of the more unique parts of Rust: borrowing and starting on traits. We might get you started on CHIP-8 as well!

With the support of a grant by the Rust Foundation, we'll be guiding you through what makes Rust stand out from the crowd, and get hands-on with some projects. First, Tic-tac-toe. Next, a Chip-8 Interpreter. Finally, a Graphics Raytracer built from the ground up. Not to be missed!
