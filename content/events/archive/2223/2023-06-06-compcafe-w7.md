You know it and you love it: ***CompCafé!*** 

Everyone is stressing from exams, so why not stress together? Join us from **5pm** onwards every **Tuesday**. 

If you have any topics you want to ask about or revise for, head on over and ask anyone around! Everyone from a range of years is present, so we can all try our best to help.

Aside from this, you can just come and hang out, we all love to talk and look at some funny content, so it's perfect if you want to destress :)

***Most importantly,*** we will be providing snacks at every session, since you need some energy this exam season with all of the studying that will be going on. 

*We hope to see you there!*
