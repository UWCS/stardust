Are *you* a 2nd Year CS/DM/CSE student trying to think of some third year project ideas? 

Or are you perhaps just interested in looking at a handful of projects done by current 3rd years?

We've gathered a **bunch** of third year students with projects covering a range of different areas and they'll be presenting their project presentations to *you*! Each talk should end with an opportunity to ask questions, and we'll be giving tips and advice throughout. We'll also take general questions in relation to the module!
