We are circling on Wednesday, June 21st at 19:00 at Terrace Bar (Tbar)! The theme will be **terrible tops**, so bring your funniest and worst pieces of clothing to the circle.

The theme includes any tops: stupid cuts, funny phrases, or just dumb designs.

We will also be heading to Pop afterwards, so make sure you get your tickets as soon as you can! *This is the last circle of the year, and it is week nine so you definitely don't have many better things to do. Just come on down and enjoy the last circle if you are still on campus! >:)*
