Warwick's Awesome Speedruns and Demos (WASD) is a 2-day speedrunning marathon run by students at the University of Warwick, UK. Now in its seventh year, it's the largest student-run speedrunning event in the UK. Our next event is WASD 2023, which will take place on 11-12th Feb 2023.

The event raises money for SpecialEffect, a charity which develops and provides assistive technology to help people with disabilities to play games.
