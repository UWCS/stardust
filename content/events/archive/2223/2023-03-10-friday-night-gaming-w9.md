Join us every Friday for a night of fun!

We have tons of consoles: Xbox with Rockband; two Switches with Mario Kart, Smash Bros and more; Wii, Xbox One and PS4 with a wide selection of games.

The other star of the show is our access to department computers with access to Steam and a selection of free games, there should be something for you to enjoy!

We also have a Valve Index VR headset, so get yourself immersed in the Metaverse games! Beat Saber may be the most commonly used, but we have quite the library as well.

Don't worry, we aren't done yet. We'll have a range of Jackbox games and similar party games going throughout the night.
