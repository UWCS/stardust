The Oaks have allowed us to make use of their kitchen space! We'll be taking them up on that to make the society's favourite food: Pizza!

We will provide pizza dough, sauce, cheese and a selection of toppings, vegetables and meats, for you to make your own pizza. Feel free to share with other people though! 

You can bring your own toppings if you wish for something specific or just want to put loads of olives on (there is only so much we will bring).

Due to only having one oven. Attendance will be sign up only and limited to 20 individuals. A google form will be released on discord and Instagram on Tuesday and will operate on a first come first serve basis. If you fill out the form and can no longer make it please let one of the Social secs know.
