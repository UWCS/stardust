*Aimed at complete beginners to programming!*  Week 1 is kicking off with a talk from us outlining the course and some basic Python concepts, followed by a workshop session to put them in practice. This course will take you from a complete novice to creating a quiz program, so if you've fancied creating some gadgets, a website, or automating some daily task: this course will bring anyone up to speed!

We'll be collaborating on these sessions with [Warwick AI](https://warwick.ai/) and [Coding Society](https://www.warwickcodingsociety.com/). Each week will be taught by a different society and will last 6 weeks in total.
