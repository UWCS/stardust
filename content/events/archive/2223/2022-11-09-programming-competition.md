Our very own team programming contest, UWCS Challenge, is happening this Wednesday!

🔵 Take part in teams of up to 3
🔺 Solve 5 programming challenges of increasing difficulty
🟩 Score in the top 3 teams to win a concerning amount of chocolate, exclusive t-shirts, and Amazon gift cards!

It's good practice for technical interviews, supported by the Department of Computer Science, and hopefully you'll have a good time. Want to take part? Just grab a team (or don't) and turn up on the day!

Any questions? Drop them in #progcomps on Discord. Hope to see you there... 

Previous questions can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/UWCS/progcomps/releases/tag/v1.0.0), though we'll be revamping the marking system
