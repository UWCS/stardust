The end of term is *rapidly* approaching, and we'll be having our end of term meal on Wednesday Week 9. As the last one was so popular, we'll be going to **The Blue Orchid** again in Coventry at 19:30.

Join us to have some fun conversations,  make fun of the society, and prepare for the **end** of the academic year! This is the end of the term meal, along with the end of the academic year, so you should definitely come by if you can and let's celebrate! 🥳
