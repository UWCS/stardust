We are circling 13 March 2023 20:00 at Ivy House! The theme will be **anything but a cup** - bring a container to drink out of during the circle that is not a cup! 

Valid items could be: a shoe! a plant pot! a small watering can!

If you buy 4 drinks, you will also be given a queue jump for Kasbah and we aim to go there post-circle, so make sure the thing you bring to drink out of can be disposed of before we get there.
