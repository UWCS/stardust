*Aimed at complete beginners to programming!*  Week 6 will follow in a similar style, and back to being run by us! It will cover Efficiency, Compactness, Readability and will put it in practice like last week. This course will take you from a complete novice to creating a quiz program, so if you've fancied creating some gadgets, a website, or automating some daily task: this course will bring anyone up to speed!

We'll be collaborating on these sessions with [Warwick AI](https://warwick.ai/) and [Coding Society](https://www.warwickcodingsociety.com/). Each week will be taught by a different society and will last 6 weeks in total.
