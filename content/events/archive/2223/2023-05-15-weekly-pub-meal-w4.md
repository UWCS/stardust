Exams suck. We all know this. *Despite this,* please do take a break and go out for some fresh air! Whilst doing that, why don't you join us at our weekly pub meal?

Join us for our weekly pub meal and take a chance to unwind and talk with a few of us whilst we grab a bite to eat!

*We are doing it at the Dirty Duck this week because last week we had a last minute, unexpected change to Phantom Coach*
