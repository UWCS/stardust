Following on from our rapid-pace Git Good talk ([uwcs.co.uk/resources/git-good](https://uwcs.co.uk/resources/git-good/)) we will be giving you hands-on experience with Git. You will get practice with everything the talk covered, which is invaluable to see the benefits and internalize the lessons. We'll also have some experienced exec members on hand to answer any of the many questions that arise from your first(?) journey into version control.
