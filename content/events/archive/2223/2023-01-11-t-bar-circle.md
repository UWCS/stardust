We are circling in Week 1 in T-Bar! We expect to start at 7:15PM, so get there early or face the consequences :P
The theme will be white tees! Make sure it's one you're okay with being written on, and optionally bring a marker, we'll be bringing plenty spare too.

**No ticket is needed**, though if you want to go to Pop after get the Pop only ticket!

After circling we will be proceeding to Pop, so get your tickets if you want to come! Week 1 tickets often sell out quickly, so be prepared when they release. You only need the Pop ticket, not the Pop + circle one as no tickets are required for circling in T-Bar.
