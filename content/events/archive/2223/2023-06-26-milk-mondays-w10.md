This is it folks, the **final** 𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕜 𝕞𝕠𝕟𝕕𝕒𝕪 of the year! This is your last opportunity to obtain *free* 𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕜. If you are still on campus, or even nearby, this Monday, you s͟h͟o͟u͟l͟d͟ pass by and yoink some 𝕞𝕚𝕝𝕜!

**Every** Monday you can find a variety of milks available in the Department of Computer Science Atrium (plant-based options included). Come by, grab a cup, and have a little chat with some of us :)
