at our recent agm, we elected our new exec (who we will introduce to you all very soon!) congrats to everyone who took part!

more importantly, members submitted their very serious motions and seriously voted on them.

thats why, for the forseeable future, UWCS milk mondays will be happening WEEKLY!

(i am out of a job in a few weeks time so good luck to the new exec, who have to deal with this)
