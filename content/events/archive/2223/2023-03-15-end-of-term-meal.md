The end of term is rapidly approaching, and we'll be having our end of term meal on Wednesday Week 10 in 7 days. As the last one was so popular, we'll be going to **The Blue Orchid** again in Coventry at 19:00 PM, getting the bus from campus at around 18:20PM from Warwick University Interchange.

**Update: Moved to Wednesday as Circling is now on Monday**
