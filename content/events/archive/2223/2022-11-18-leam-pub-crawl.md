We'll be starting in TBar on campus at 6pm  to cash in on bus stop which happens 5-7, and will be moving on from there according to the schedule below. We've got a great selection of pubs/bars we'll be going to as we stumble walk from north to south-ish Leam and will be finishing off the night in Kelsey's Bar!
