\*\*EDIT: Circling Tickets have run out, we're now moving pre-drinks to TBar so just buy an EVENT ticket before the day\*\*

Join Comp Soc in enjoying Week 9 POP before the coursework crunch.  
We'll be drinking in TBar before hand, if you're lost just look out for the group complaining about Overwatch nerfs.  
We're not going to be enforcing a theme so feel free to come in something casual and comfy.  
  
We may be doing some light circling but pre-drinks are meant to be relaxing.  

Please show your interest on the Facebook event so a spot can be booked.
