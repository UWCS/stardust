Come join Comp Soc for a nice meal together to celebrate the beginning of the revision period and the handover to new exec.

We plan to arrive at the farmhouse by **1830**. We'll be meeting at DCS at **1745 **and leaving no later than **1750 **to move out to the Farmhouse.  

The Farmhouse offer normal pub grub and a wide variety of curry, including vegetarian options, you can view the menu here: <http://thefarmhouserestaurant.co.uk/menu/>  

There is still gaming on afterwards, with a later start of **2100**.
