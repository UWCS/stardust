Sign up link for Secret Santa: <https://uwcs.co.uk/events/secret-santa-2017/>  
**Do not sign up for the Secret Santa if you only want to come to the meal.**  
  
Come join Comp Soc for a nice meal together. Times should be after DCS
end of term drinks so grab some free booze before you arrive.

  

**UPDATE**

We'll be meeting at DCS at **1745** and leaving no later than **1750** to move out to the Farmhouse. We plan to arrive at the farmhouse no later than **1830** so people joining us there be aware of the timings.  
  
We'll also be holding our Secret Santa Gift Swap during the meal as well
so if you're participating in that you'll need to attend this to give
and recieve your gift. Sign up using the link at the top of the event
and remember you must attend the gift swap at these times to take part
in the Secret Santa.  
  

The Farmhouse offer normal pub grub and a wide variety of curry, including vegetarian options, you can view the menu here: <http://thefarmhouserestaurant.co.uk/menu/>
