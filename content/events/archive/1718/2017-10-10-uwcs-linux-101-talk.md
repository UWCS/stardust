If you have never used the Linux operating system and find it overwhelming, or if you feel like sharpening your terminal-foo, then this is the talk for you. Our academic president will be delivering a talk aimed at those who would like to get started with Linux. We'll be handing out our Linux cheat sheet and free pizza to all attendees, too\!

We hope to see you there\!
