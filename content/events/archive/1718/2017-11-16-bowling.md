Come down to Leamington Spa and throw some strikes. Facilities include a bar with food, pool tables, air hockey and a full arcade including a proper DDR machine suitable for two players or the strange variant where one person uses all eight pads.  
  
Transport Plan - Campus Interchange 1800

For those who want to meet up on campus before going into Leamington Spa, we plan to meet at 1800 at bus interchange. From there we'll catch the 11 bus down to the church and walk from there. The 11 bus has cheaper tickets and group evening tickets for Â£5 for 5 people. 

If you have a bus pass for Stagecoach buses feel free to catch your bus into Leamington and meet us at Tenpin.  
  

Student discount is available as well.
