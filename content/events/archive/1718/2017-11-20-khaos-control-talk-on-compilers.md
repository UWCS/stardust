Khaos Control is a software engineering company specialising in the development of stock control software that face some interesting and unusual challenges. To tackle some of them, the development team at Khaos Control actively maintain and develop their own in-house language compiler, something that many firms do not do. This week's academic talk will be about this compiler, its development and maintenance, and its usage. Presenting the talk will be David Capps, a former UWCS member and product development manager for Khaos Control.
