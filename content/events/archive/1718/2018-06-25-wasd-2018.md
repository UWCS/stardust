Members of the society are invited to show off their skills in a game of their choice by either speedrunning it or giving a demo\! The event will be livestreamed on Warwick eSports Twitch account (front page of Twitch is now confirmed too\!), but last years VODs can be found here: <https://www.twitch.tv/uwcs>.  

This year, we're raising money for [SpecialEffect](https://www.specialeffect.org.uk)\! We'll also be handing out some Discord swag to people taking part that impress us in some way.
