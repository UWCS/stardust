It’s the last term of the year\! To take your mind off revision and the impending doom of exams, we’ll  be hosting a society meal at the start of term at the Farmhouse. The Farmhouse serves both English and Indian meals and are very accommodating with any dietary requirements. It’ll be great fun and we hope to see you there\!
