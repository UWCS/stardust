"Warwick Student Cinema presents an event so huge, it can only happen once a year; the Outdoor Screening. This year WSC is proud to bring you Monsters Inc. This fantastic event is absolutely free, and everyone on campus and beyond is warmly invited to attend."

We'll be setting off from Lib 2 (the LAN) a short time before the film begins.
