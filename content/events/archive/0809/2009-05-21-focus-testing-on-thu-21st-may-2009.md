This is an opportunity for you to travel to FSG in Leamington and test their latest title: Project Hero. Whilst there, you will be asked to provided detailed feedback on your experience with playing the game.

However, FSG have said that they would prefer testers with some experience playing rhythm action/music games in the past, particularly experience with Guitar Hero or Rock Band; and I would ask you please to sign up only if you have this. Owing to the game's nature, it's obviously preferable if you're interested in the genre of music that the title is obviously aimed at.

There is, as yet, no firm date for this; which will be decided dependent on numbers and may be slightly flexible However, it is likely to take place in the next 2-3 weeks (presumably in weeks 4-5, perhaps 6).

When signing up, please state both your experience with playing rhythm action titles, and times/dates which would be preferable.

You will probably have to sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) to partake in this.

UPDATE: There are two sessions, one 2-4PM, one 6-8PM.

AS THE EVENT IS NOW FULL, SIGNUPS WILL BE TREATED AS RESERVES.
