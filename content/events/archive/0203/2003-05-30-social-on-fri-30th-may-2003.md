The Matrix Reloaded: we'll be taking the bus (12) to Warwick Road (the stop just after the station), and walking for 10-15 mins to the Coventry Odeon/SkyDome, for the 1pm showing. It's not expected to be full, so we're not booking, just turn up with money. Tickets are £4.20 and the bus is £0.85 each way. Signups are purely to let us know if it reaches 10 people: if it does, someone might want to book it, to get a discount.
