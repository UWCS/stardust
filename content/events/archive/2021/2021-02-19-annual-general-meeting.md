## **What is an AGM?**

Every year societies elect their exec during term 2 at their AGM. These positions will be held from the start of term 3 to the end of term 2 the following year. The AGM is also a chance for the exec to meet with their membership to discuss the running of the society, so you should still attend if you have an interest in the society even if you don't want to run for exec. We'd love to hear from you regarding what we're doing well, and what we could be doing better.

## **Roles available**

These are the roles available to run for. You can run for multiple roles, but if you win in more than one you will have to choose which position to hold. You will be able to nominate yourself on the day for whichever role(s) you are interested in and optionally give a short speech. The voting period will last 48 hours to allow for anyone who is unable to attend. If you are unable to attend and wish to stand, please email our returning officer <returningofficer@uwcs.co.uk> with your name and a short manifesto.

  - President
  - Secretary
  - Academic Coordinator
  - Gaming Coordinator
  - Treasurer
  - Tech Officer
  - Women's Officer
  - Social Secretary

For more information on each role and their responsibilities, see: <https://uwcs.co.uk/about/exec>

## **How it will be run**

We will be using Teams for the event, but will also stream it to the Discord server. Links to the Teams event and how to vote will be announced nearer the time. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in **\#exec** on our Discord, or message one of the exec if you'd rather ask in private.

## Motions

We have five constitutional motions that will be voted on:

  - **Motion to add a society flag**
  - **Motion to add a society motto**
  - **Motion to introduce a Society Mascot**
  - **Motion to index naturally**
  - **Motion to Temporarily Rename the University of Warwick Computing Society (UWCS) in recognition of Anime Day**
