We will be holding an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on **Monday 28th June** at **6PM** to elect a new president for UWCS. The president is in charge of the day-to-day operations of the society, represents the society in an official capacity, and manages the exec committee among other responsibilities. While you can nominate yourself on the day, we welcome nominations ahead of time. You will also have the opportunity to give a short speech on the day. Please contact Anna, our returning officer, via <returning-officer@uwcs.co.uk> if you wish to nominate yourself for this role.

We will also be presenting a constitution-changing motion at the EGM: **Motion to Require the Appointment of a Standing President in the Event of Extended Absence of Resignation of the President**. You can view the motion here: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sFINrjXKkp6ntxxgNkNxbCQ-murXj8NtxSbVrWDoHXk/edit?usp=sharing>

Voting will follow the STV process and be held on the same voting portal used in the AGM Elections earlier this year. The voting period will last 2 days and will open shortly after the EGM finishes. Results will be announced on Thursday 1st July.

If you were an official member of the society as of Monday 14th June, you will be eligible to vote in this election and on the motion, as well as being eligible to stand for President. Anyone who became a member after this date is not eligible to vote in this election. Please contact Anna, our returning officer, via <returning-officer@uwcs.co.uk> if you are not sure if you are included in this.

The EGM will be held on Teams and we will provide a link to join this nearer the time. We will also cross-stream the EGM to our Discord server.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in \#exec in our [Discord server](https://discord.uwcs.uk), or message one of the exec directly if you'd rather ask in private.
