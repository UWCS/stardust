Version control is a vital skill for computer scientists, considered more valuable to employers than ever before. Whether you're a lone programmer working on a pet project, or a huge team of hundreds of people working at several offices around the world on millions of lines of code - version control is extremely useful to help you organise your codebase.

This talk by the Computing Society will introduce **Git**, the most popular version control system in use today. The talk will cover what Git is, the principles behind it, and how you can start using it in your own projects and university work. The talk's aimed at those with any levels of technical skill\! 

We'll be running a Q\&A/Drop-in session on Discord afterwards, so hopefully we should be able to answer any questions you have there\!
