Our first gaming session of the term\!  

Every Friday during term we usually host an all-night gaming session in the computer science department building (the DCS). This term we will still be hosting the event but it will be online. Our [Discord server](http://discord.uwcs.co.uk) is used by a huge selection of students with a variety of gaming interests, and a number of voice channels for gaming groups, as well as a lobby for finding people to play games with.  

The session, like our in-person event, will be drop in - so don't have to arrive just as it starts or stay until it ends.
