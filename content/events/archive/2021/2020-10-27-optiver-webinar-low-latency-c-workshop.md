Do you want to learn how to write the fastest and best performing code possible? Are you ready to dive into assembly, cache internals and squeeze the last nanosecond out of your code? If so, then join our low-latency workshop on code optimisation\!

During this workshop one of our engineers will demonstrate some of the profiling and micro-benchmarking techniques used when developing low-latency code. Through concrete code examples, we will share some of the performance tips and tricks attained from our vast experience in writing fast, maintainable and modern C++ code. We will look into assembly generated by the compiler to understand how seemingly small code changes affect the work a processor needs to do.

Whether you write games, mobile applications or trading software, these techniques will help you to write faster and more efficient code\!

*Please note this webinar is suited for students with at least some pre-existing C++ knowledge.*

**A teams live event link will be available here (and on Discord) shortly\!**
