Join us for the G-Research Coding Challenge, where you'll compete in teams in a series of progressively more difficult software development challenges.

The event will involved you competing in **teams of 3-5 people** to build a natural language calculation engine (no prior NLP experience required). The challenges will cover things like evaluation of arithmetic expressions to unit conversions and equation solving.

To register, just fill out the form at <http://bit.ly/code-challenge-nov>. We will allocate teams the week before the event (or if you would like to join as a team with friends, just let us know when you register).

*Please note, you will need a fully charged laptop, a good internet connection, Chrome or Safari, and headphones to take part.*

Once you have registered you will receive a unique link to join the event which you should use to log in by 5:45 pm (GMT), so that you can meet your teammates and learn how to navigate the online event space. More information on the event will be emailed to you one day before.

Once the game is complete, you will have the opportunity to stay online for some virtual networking where you can discuss the event and life at G-Research with members of our team.

There'll be prizes for the top three teams, with each member getting an Amazon voucher - £50 for first place, £25 for second, £10 for third

*Whilst it says on the signup form that it's for penultimate or final years, we've had clarification that they won't be strict on this, so any* ***current Warwick student*** *can join in\!*
