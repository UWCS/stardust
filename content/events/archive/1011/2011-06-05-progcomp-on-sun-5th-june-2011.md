The Internet Problem Solving Contest (IPSC) is an online contest for teams consisting of up to three people. Several problems will be published at the beginning of the competition. Each problem consists of a problem description and two input data sets. To solve a problem you will have to compute correct output data for the given input data sets. Usually this means that you will write a program that solves the problem, but you may produce the output by hand or in any other way.

The IPSC 2011 contest will be held from June 5, noon CEST to June 5, 5:00 pm CEST.

For us, this means Sunday, 5 June, 11:00 to 16:00.

You must register your teams online, and add your team to the signups list so we know whose scores to look at.

Since this is an online competition, you are free to choose where to take part, but you can only compete during those 5 hours.

Prizes for the best team effort will be given out at BFL.

Good luck to all\!
