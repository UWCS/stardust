NUEL are running an inter-university 6v6 TF2 tournament, and as we have a fairly strong gaming base, we should put forward a team\!

The matches will take place on the 3rd of May from 1845, and our sign ups close as soon we we get a good team together :D

Please Sign up if interested listing any experience you have with TF2 and which classes you are good.  
Oh and your Steam ID too\!
