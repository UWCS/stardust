Back by popular demand aka heckles at pub, I bring you football. At this exact moment in time it appears sunny and warm in my room so its totally going to be warm and sunny for the time I set football at. Due to this lets play football in the field outside of DCS to make things simple and free :P. Shout at me if the time is unpopular I will try and make it viable for all.
