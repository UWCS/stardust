This talk will be from guest speaker Paul Yarrow, on the topic of "A New Dimension of Computing".

Paul Yarrow, IBM IT Architect and System Specialist explores a new dimension in computing, systems underpinning the everyday business of  
• All of the top 25 world banks  
• 71% of global Fortune 500 companies  
• 9 of the top 10 global life/health insurance providers  
IT and business-skills requirements are rapidly changing as technology advances. Nowhere is this point more clearly illustrated than in the evolution of the mainframe. The mainframe revolution that began 40 years ago never ended, and neither did the demand for these skills. The next generation of mainframe experts is needed now, to help more companies and organizations leverage the superior security, availability, scalability, and efficiency of modern mainframe technologies and concepts.
