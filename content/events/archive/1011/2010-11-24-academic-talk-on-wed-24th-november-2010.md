The Computing Society's second guest lecture of the year is being given by Gray Bachelor, a Solution Architect from the IBM Solution Group.

With over 30 years focusing on the Electronics Industry, Gray is a leader in Innovation processes, methods, tools, product development and lifecycle processes for hardware, software and services.

As software moves toward equal ground with hardware in industries such as automobiles, aerospace and defence, there is a need for integration of mechanical, electrical and software engineering, and to have interoperability based on open standards, application life-cycle management (ALM) and product life-cycle management (PLM). Gray will explore the challenges, leading practices, advanced modelling and tools that support combined devices and IT backend including cloud. Openness and integration is where the world is heading.
