Mae Govannen

They're taking the Hobbits to L3, so we're following them.

The movies start at 7.30pm, and there will probably be a queue to buy tickets so meet in dcs around 7pm and head over shortly after.

WSC say they'll be selling snacks and drinks but it's probably a good idea to bring your own as well.

There are nine signup spaces, so these nine will be decreed to be the "Fellowship of the Watching of the Movies", and as everyone can come along, they will be the "Followers of the Fellowship of the Watching of the Movies"
