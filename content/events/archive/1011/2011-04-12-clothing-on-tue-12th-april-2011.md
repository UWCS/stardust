PLEASE READ THOROUGHLY BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER.

The long awaited clothing order, featuring our new logo.

Clothing will have the logo and society name embroidered on the left breast. prices are as follow:  
T-shirts £5.95  
Polo shirts £9.95  
Hoodies £12.95

Please specify sizes for all your clothing.

If you want an individual name on the garments (as I expect most of you will) it will cost an extra £2.50. Please specify this in your order. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR SPELLING SO I DON'T HAVE TO.

You may also order other clothing not listed above. Our supplier's catalogue is here: http://www.embroidery4u.co.uk/Clothing-Catalogue%282278736%29.htm
